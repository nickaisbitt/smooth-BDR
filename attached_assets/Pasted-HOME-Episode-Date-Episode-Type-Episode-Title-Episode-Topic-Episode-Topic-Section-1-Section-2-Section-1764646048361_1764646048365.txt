I'm Gregory, and you're tuning in to ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" Today, we're diving deep into something that hits home for so many of us – rebuilding self-worth after complex trauma. And let me tell you, if you're struggling with feeling ""not enough"" or wondering if you'll ever feel whole again, you're not alone in this. Not even close.

You know, it's funny – well, not funny-haha, but funny-interesting – how CPTSD has this sneaky way of dismantling our sense of self-worth piece by piece, often so gradually that we don't even notice it happening. One day we wake up and wonder where that confident, joyful person we used to be – or could have been – disappeared to. Trust me, I've been there, and it's like trying to build a house on quicksand.

In today's episode, we're going to unpack this mess together. We'll start by getting real about what CPTSD does to our self-worth – the science behind it, the emotional toll, and why traditional self-help advice often misses the mark for trauma survivors. I've got some powerful listener stories to share that I think will resonate with many of you – stories that remind us we're all in this together, fighting the same invisible battles.

But here's the thing – we're not just here to commiserate. I'm going to walk you through some practical, trauma-informed techniques that actually work for rebuilding self-worth from the ground up. None of that ""just think positive"" bullshit – we're talking real, evidence-based strategies that acknowledge the complexity of trauma recovery.

And because I know how overwhelming this work can be, I'll be sharing some resources and next steps that you can explore at your own pace. Remember, healing isn't a race, and you don't have to figure it all out today. Sometimes just showing up and listening is the most powerful thing you can do for yourself.

This episode is especially close to my heart because rebuilding self-worth is such a fundamental part of healing from CPTSD. It's like the foundation we need to build before anything else can truly stick. And while it might feel impossible right now, I promise you – with the right tools and support, it is absolutely possible to rediscover your worth and build it stronger than ever.

So grab your favorite comfort beverage, find a cozy spot, and let's dig into this together. Whether you're just starting to understand your CPTSD or you're well along in your healing journey, there's something here for you. And remember, as we always say here – you're not broken, you're healing. And healing, messy as it is, is always possible.

Let's make sense of this shit together, shall we?

So let me share something personal with you about self-worth, because honestly, this topic hits really close to home. You know those moments when you're standing in front of the mirror, and that inner critic starts running its mouth? Yeah, I've been there – probably spent way too many years there, if I'm being real with you.

I remember this one time, about six years ago, when I was supposed to give this important presentation at work. And there I was, sitting in my car outside the building, completely frozen. Not because I wasn't prepared – I'd practiced that presentation until I could recite it in my sleep. No, I was frozen because that voice in my head kept insisting I wasn't ""enough."" Not smart enough, not qualified enough, not worthy enough to be in that room.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. Back then, I didn't have the language for what I was experiencing. I just thought I was fundamentally flawed, you know? Like somehow everyone else got this manual for life that I'd missed out on. But what I've come to understand – and what I want you to really hear – is that this wasn't some personal defect. This was CPTSD working its sneaky little magic on my sense of self-worth.

The thing about self-worth and CPTSD is that they're like oil and water – they don't naturally mix. When you've grown up in an environment where your worth was constantly questioned, dismissed, or straight-up denied, your brain actually rewires itself to maintain that narrative. It's like your nervous system gets stuck in this loop of ""not enough-ness.""

But here's the plot twist – and I love a good plot twist – that narrative isn't actually yours. It's a hand-me-down story that you've been carrying around, probably for years. Think about it: if you had a plant, and every day someone came by and told that plant it was worthless, would that make it any less of a plant? No, but it might affect how that plant grows.

The same goes for us. The messages we received during our formative years – whether through obvious trauma or those subtle, death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of experiences – they shaped our self-worth, but they don't define it. And that's what we're going to dig into today.

You know what's wild? When I first started this healing journey, I thought rebuilding self-worth was going to be about positive affirmations and maybe some fancy meditation techniques. Don't get me wrong, those things can be helpful tools, but the real work? It's so much more nuanced than that. It's about excavating those old beliefs, examining them under the light of adult understanding, and slowly – sometimes painfully slowly – building new neural pathways.

I had this breakthrough moment in therapy (shoutout to my therapist Sarah, who probably isn't listening but deserves a medal anyway). She asked me to imagine my younger self, that kid who was trying so hard to be perfect, to be worthy of love and attention. And instead of feeling the usual shame and frustration, for the first time, I felt this overwhelming compassion. Like, damn, that kid was doing the best he could with what he had.

That's when it hit me – rebuilding self-worth isn't about becoming worthy. You already are worthy. It's about unlearning all the stuff that made you believe you weren't. And let me tell you, that's both the hardest and most liberating realization I've ever had.

Throughout this episode, we're going to explore this journey together. We'll look at how CPTSD specifically impacts self-worth, share some stories from our amazing community (with their permission, of course), and dig into practical tools that actually work in the real world – not just in theory.

What makes this conversation so important is that self-worth isn't just some fluffy self-help concept. It's the foundation of how we move through the world, how we set boundaries, how we choose relationships, and how we handle life's inevitable challenges. When you're operating from a place of compromised self-worth, it's like trying to build a house on quicksand. Everything feels unstable because, well, it is.

But here's the good news – and I mean really good news: just like our brains adapted to protect us during trauma, they can adapt again to support our healing. The science behind this is fascinating, and we'll get into that too. Because understanding how your brain works can be incredibly empowering when you're doing this deep work of rebuilding self-worth.

So grab your metaphorical hard hat, because we're about to do some serious reconstruction work. And remember, you're not alone in this. Every single person listening right now who's dealing with CPTSD has their own version of this struggle. We're all in this together, figuring it out one day at a time.

So let's really dig into what happens when CPTSD takes a wrecking ball to our sense of self-worth, because this is where the rubber meets the road. You know that feeling when you look in the mirror and the person staring back feels... wrong somehow? Like you're wearing someone else's skin? Yeah, that's what we're talking about.

Here's what I've learned from my own journey and from working with countless survivors: when trauma repeatedly tells us we're not enough, we start believing it's our default setting. It's like someone installed faulty software in our brains, and now every experience gets filtered through this ""I'm worthless"" lens. But here's the kicker – that software wasn't part of your original operating system. You weren't born thinking you were worthless.

Let me share something that happened to me last week. I was giving a presentation, and I made a small mistake – literally just stumbled over a word. No big deal, right? But my inner critic, that voice that CPTSD loves to amplify, started screaming: ""You're a fraud. Everyone knows you're a mess. Why do you even try?"" Sound familiar? That's the legacy of complex trauma talking, not reality.

The thing is, rebuilding self-worth isn't about positive affirmations or trying to convince yourself you're awesome. Trust me, I've tried that route, and it's about as effective as putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg. What actually works is understanding how your worth got damaged in the first place. Think of it like being an archeologist of your own history – you've got to carefully uncover the layers to see what's really going on underneath.

For many of us with CPTSD, our sense of worth was compromised during those critical developmental years when we were supposed to be learning that we mattered. Maybe you had a parent who was physically present but emotionally checked out. Or perhaps you were the family scapegoat, always somehow wrong, always somehow to blame. These experiences don't just disappear when we grow up – they become the foundation we build our adult lives on.

Now, here's where it gets interesting – and by interesting, I mean totally infuriating. Our brains, trying to protect us, actually start to resist building self-worth. It's like there's this internal saboteur saying, ""Hold up! Low self-worth is familiar. Low self-worth is safe. If we start feeling good about ourselves, something bad might happen!"" I call this the ""worth wobble"" – that uncomfortable feeling when you start to succeed or feel good about yourself, and suddenly your brain hits the panic button.

But here's the truth bomb I want to drop right now: your worth isn't actually damaged. It never was. What's damaged is your ability to access and believe in your inherent worth. Think about that for a second. Your worth is like the sun – it's always there, even when clouds of trauma block it from view.

The reconstruction process starts with understanding this fundamental truth. It's not about building something new; it's about clearing away the debris that's keeping you from seeing what was always there. And yes, this process can feel overwhelming. There will be days when you want to throw in the towel and go back to the familiar comfort of self-doubt. That's normal. That's human.

Let me tell you about a client – we'll call her Sarah – who perfectly illustrated this process. Sarah came to therapy believing she was, in her words, ""fundamentally broken."" She had this successful career, great friends, but inside? She felt like an impostor in her own life. Through our work together, she started to recognize how her childhood experiences of emotional neglect had created this disconnect between her actual capabilities and her sense of worth.

The breakthrough came when she realized that every time she started feeling confident, she'd unconsciously sabotage herself. Why? Because confidence felt dangerous. In her childhood home, standing out or showing pride in herself meant being cut down to size. Once she could see this pattern, she could start challenging it.

This is where the real work begins – in those small, daily moments when you catch yourself automatically defaulting to self-doubt or self-criticism. It's about creating new neural pathways, new ways of responding to yourself. And let me tell you, it's not always pretty. Sometimes it's messy, sometimes it's two steps forward and one step back, but that's okay. That's part of the process.

What matters is that you're here, doing the work, showing up for yourself maybe for the first time in your life. And speaking of showing up for yourself, I want you to pay attention to something: that voice inside that's been saying ""this won't work for me"" or ""I'm too broken"" while you've been listening? That's not your voice. That's the voice of trauma, and we're going to learn how to turn down its volume.

Remember, rebuilding self-worth with CPTSD isn't about becoming a different person – it's about uncovering who you've been all along, beneath the layers of trauma responses and survival mechanisms. It's about reclaiming your right to take up space in the world, to have needs, to make mistakes, to be gloriously, imperfectly human.

Let's pause here for a moment and let that sink in, because what comes next is where we start getting really practical about how to put these insights into action. And trust me, you're going to want to hear this...

You know what's fascinating? The science behind all of this actually backs up what so many of us have experienced in our healing journeys. Let me share some research that really blew my mind when I first discovered it – and I think it'll resonate with you too.

Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, who literally wrote the book on trauma with ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" found that trauma fundamentally changes how our brains process self-worth. His research shows that the areas of our brain responsible for self-perception – particularly the medial prefrontal cortex – actually show reduced activity in people with CPTSD. But here's the hopeful part: these changes aren't permanent. Our brains have this amazing ability called neuroplasticity, which means we can literally rewire those neural pathways.

I remember sitting in my therapist's office when I first learned about this, thinking ""Holy shit, you mean my brain isn't permanently broken?"" And the answer is a resounding no. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress showed that targeted interventions focusing on self-worth could actually increase activity in those same brain regions within just 12 weeks. That's pretty damn impressive, right?

But here's where it gets even more interesting. Dr. Christine Courtois, who's been studying complex trauma for decades, found that self-worth reconstruction happens in stages. Her research shows that we can't just jump from self-loathing to self-love – it's more like building a house. You need the foundation first, then the walls, then the roof. And guess what? That matches exactly what many of you have been sharing in your stories.

Now, let me tell you about a study that really hits home. Researchers at the University of California conducted a long-term study following survivors of chronic childhood trauma. They found that people who successfully rebuilt their self-worth typically went through what they called the ""Triple-R Process"": Recognition, Reframing, and Reclamation. Sound familiar? It's exactly what Sarah was describing in her story earlier.

Here's something that might surprise you – a 2020 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology found that self-worth recovery isn't just about positive thinking. In fact, forcing positive thoughts without addressing the underlying trauma can actually be counterproductive. It's like putting a fresh coat of paint on a crumbling wall – looks nice for a minute, but it's not fixing the structural issues.

Instead, the research points to something called ""compassionate self-awareness."" Dr. Kristin Neff's work shows that people who develop self-compassion – not just self-esteem – show more resilience and stable self-worth over time. And get this: they found that self-compassion actually changes our cortisol levels. That's right, being kind to yourself literally changes your body's stress response.

Let me share something personal here. When I first read these studies, I felt this weird mix of validation and frustration. Validation because finally, here was scientific proof of what we've been experiencing. Frustration because, well, why the hell didn't anyone tell us this sooner? But that's exactly why we're talking about it now.

The research also shows something really important about shame – you know, that lovely little companion that likes to tell us we're not worthy. Dr. Brené Brown's research demonstrates that shame resilience is actually a learnable skill. Her studies show that people who develop shame resilience aren't immune to feeling shame (wouldn't that be nice?), but they recover from it faster and it has less power over their self-worth.

Here's a mind-bending finding from a 2021 study in the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation: our self-worth actually has a physical component. They found that trauma survivors who engaged in regular body-based practices – like yoga or dance – showed significant improvements in their sense of self-worth compared to those who only did talk therapy. It's like our bodies need to learn we're worthy just as much as our minds do.

But perhaps the most encouraging research comes from the field of post-traumatic growth. Studies by Dr. Richard Tedeschi and Dr. Lawrence Calhoun show that many trauma survivors don't just recover – they actually develop stronger self-worth than they had before. They call it ""stress-induced growth,"" but I like to think of it as our emotional immune system getting stronger after fighting off an infection.

Now, here's where the science gets really practical. A 2022 longitudinal study followed CPTSD survivors for five years and found that the most successful recovery journeys had three common elements: consistent support systems, gradual exposure to healthy relationships, and regular practice of self-advocacy. In other words, we can't do this alone, and we shouldn't have to.

The research also validates something many of us have felt intuitively – recovery isn't linear. Dr. Judith Herman's updated work shows that healing from complex trauma follows more of a spiral pattern, where we revisit similar themes but from progressively stronger positions. So those times when you feel like you're going backwards? That's actually a normal part of the process.

You know what really gets me excited? The emerging research on neurogenesis – our brain's ability to create new neurons throughout our lives. Studies show that every time we practice self-compassion or challenge a negative self-belief, we're literally growing new neural pathways. We're not just healing; we're evolving.

Let me wrap up this research section with something powerful: a 2023 study found that understanding the science behind trauma recovery actually improved outcomes for survivors. Just knowing that there's solid research backing up our experiences, understanding that our struggles are valid and our healing is possible – that knowledge itself becomes part of our recovery toolkit.

And speaking of tools, that's exactly where we're heading next. Because while all this research is fascinating, what really matters is how we can use it in our daily lives to rebuild our sense of worth...

You know what's fascinating about rebuilding self-worth after CPTSD? It's like renovating a house that's still standing, but the foundation needs serious work. And here's where it gets really interesting – we often try to fix the paint and decor first, when what we really need is to shore up those foundational beliefs about ourselves.

Let me share something that blew my mind when I first learned it: our self-worth isn't actually built on achievements or other people's approval – though God knows many of us tried that route, right?  No, it's built on this radical concept of inherent value. And I say ""radical"" because for those of us with CPTSD, believing we have inherent worth feels about as natural as tap-dancing on Jupiter.

Now, here's where things get juicy. When we're dealing with developmental trauma, our brain literally got wired to question our worth at every turn. It's like we've got this internal critic on steroids, and it's working overtime to ""protect"" us by keeping us small. The kicker? That critic thinks it's doing us a favor. Wild, right?

But check this out – and this is something I wish someone had told me years ago – the path to rebuilding self-worth isn't about fighting that critic. It's about understanding it, then gradually showing it that the danger has passed. Think of it like taming a very scared, very aggressive guard dog. You don't yell at it for barking; you show it that the world is safer than it thinks.

Let's go deeper into this, because this is where so many of us get stuck. We've internalized this idea that we're somehow fundamentally flawed, and we keep looking for evidence to support that belief. It's like we're collecting receipts for our own unworthiness.  Sound familiar? Yeah, I thought it might.

But here's the thing that changed everything for me: what if we're not actually broken? What if all those adaptations – the people-pleasing, the perfectionism, the hypervigilance – were actually brilliant survival strategies? Because that's exactly what they were. You didn't develop these patterns because you were weak; you developed them because you were strong enough to survive some seriously tough shit.

Now, I can hear some of you thinking, ""Great, Gregory, but how does understanding this actually help me feel worthy?"" And that's exactly the right question. Because insight without action is just intellectual masturbation – feels good in the moment but doesn't actually get you anywhere. 

The real transformation happens when we start practicing what I call ""worth-building behaviors."" These aren't your typical self-help exercises – we're talking about fundamental shifts in how we relate to ourselves. It's about catching those moments when we automatically defer to others and asking, ""What would I do if I believed I mattered just as much?"" It's about noticing when we minimize our achievements and practicing sitting with pride instead of shame.

And let me tell you something crucial about this process – it feels fake as hell at first. Seriously, when I started practicing self-worth, I felt like the world's worst actor. But here's the secret: your nervous system doesn't know the difference between ""fake it till you make it"" and the real deal. It responds to practice, to repetition, to the gradual accumulation of new experiences.

Think about it like learning a new language. At first, every word feels clumsy and foreign. You're constantly translating in your head, and it's exhausting. But eventually, without even noticing when it happened, you start thinking in that new language. That's exactly what happens when we practice self-worth – we're literally learning to speak a new emotional language.

The really beautiful part? This isn't about becoming someone new. It's about uncovering who you've been all along, beneath the layers of trauma and adaptation. It's like archaeology of the self, brushing away the dirt to reveal the precious artifacts that were always there.

And yes, there will be setbacks. Days when that inner critic is screaming so loud you can barely hear yourself think. Days when you fall back into old patterns of self-doubt and shame. But here's what I want you to remember: setbacks aren't failures. They're part of the process. They're opportunities to practice self-compassion, which, ironically, is one of the most powerful worth-building behaviors we can engage in.

You know what's really wild? As your sense of worth starts to rebuild, you'll notice changes in areas of your life you didn't even realize were connected. Boundaries become easier to set. Relationships start to shift. You'll find yourself making different choices, not because you're forcing yourself to, but because they naturally align with your growing sense of self-worth.

This is deep work, my friends. It's not always comfortable, and it's definitely not linear. But it is possible. And more than that, it's your birthright. Because despite what your trauma may have taught you, despite what those early experiences might have suggested, you are worthy. Not because of what you do or what you achieve, but simply because you exist.

And that truth? That's the foundation we're rebuilding on. Everything else – the tools, the techniques, the practices – they all stem from this core reality. Your worth isn't something you need to earn or prove. It's something you need to remember.

You know what really drives this point home for me? The stories I hear from our community. They're like individual pieces of a massive mosaic, each one showing different paths to reclaiming self-worth, and honestly? They're fucking inspiring.

Let me tell you about Sarah – and of course, that's not her real name, I always change details to protect privacy. Sarah wrote to me about growing up with a mother who measured love in achievements. A-plus or nothing, first place or don't bother coming home. She internalized this so deeply that by her thirties, she had three degrees, a corner office, and a constant, gnawing feeling that she was still somehow not enough.

""Gregory,"" she wrote, ""I had this moment in therapy where I realized I was still trying to earn my mom's gold star at forty-two years old. I was sitting there listing off all my accomplishments like items on a grocery list, and my therapist just asked, 'But what makes you happy?' And I... I just broke down because I had no fucking clue.""

Here's where it gets good though – Sarah started small. She began doing one thing each day just because she wanted to, not because it would look good on a resume or impress anyone. Some days it was watching cartoons in her pajamas. Others, it was taking a painting class where she was gloriously, absolutely terrible at it. And you know what? She started feeling more alive, more real, more... herself.

Then there's Marcus – his story hit me particularly hard because it shows how our work environments can reinforce these patterns we're trying to break. He spent fifteen years in a toxic corporate culture where his worth was measured in billable hours and client feedback scores. Sound familiar to anyone? Yeah, I thought so.

Marcus shared how he'd developed this habit of apologizing for everything – taking bathroom breaks, eating lunch, having a life outside work. It was like he was apologizing for existing in spaces that weren't directly productive. But the turning point? It came from an unexpected place.

""I was apologizing to my five-year-old nephew for having to take a phone call during our time together,"" he wrote, ""and this kid looks at me and says, 'Uncle Marcus, you don't have to say sorry for everything.' From the mouths of babes, right?""

That moment sparked something in Marcus. He started tracking his apologies – not to shame himself, but to understand the pattern. And holy shit, was it eye-opening. He was apologizing for things like taking up space in elevators, for having emotions, for needing help with projects. Classic CPTSD stuff, right?

Let me share another story that I think will resonate with many of you. Jamie – who wrote to us from somewhere in the Pacific Northwest – described their journey as ""learning to exist without a permission slip."" Fuck, if that isn't the perfect way to put it.

They grew up in an environment where their gender expression, their creative interests, even their food preferences were constantly policed and criticized. By adulthood, they had this elaborate internal system of checks and balances for every decision, every movement, every breath. Sound exhausting? It was.

""I realized I was treating myself like a perpetual trespasser in my own life,"" Jamie wrote. ""I was constantly looking for someone to validate my right to be anywhere, do anything, feel anything. It was like I was living in a house where I had to ask permission to sit on my own furniture.""

The way Jamie started rebuilding their sense of self-worth was beautiful in its simplicity. They started with their space – their apartment. They painted one wall bright yellow. Not because it was tasteful or because anyone else would like it, but because they wanted to wake up to sunshine even on grey days. It was a fuck-you to every voice that had ever told them to make themselves smaller, more palatable, less... them.

And you know what? These stories – Sarah's, Marcus's, Jamie's – they're not extraordinary because they're rare. They're extraordinary because they're so damn common. They're variations on the same theme we all know: the journey from ""I must earn my worth"" to ""I am worthy because I exist.""

I received a letter just last week from Alex, who described what they called their ""worth revolution."" They wrote about how they used to think self-worth was like a bank account – you had to make deposits of achievements, good deeds, and perfect behavior to build it up. But life has a way of teaching us, doesn't it?

Alex got sick – the kind of sick that takes you out of the game for months. No more achievements. No more perfectly curated social media presence. No more being the reliable one, the strong one, the one who has their shit together. And in that stripped-down state, they found something profound.

""It was like the universe forced me to learn what you've been saying all along,"" they wrote. ""My worth didn't disappear when I couldn't perform anymore. It was there in the people who brought me soup, in the cat who slept on my feet, in the simple act of breathing in and out. It was always there. I just couldn't see it through all the doing.""

These stories, every single one of them, they're not just about individual journeys. They're mirrors reflecting back our own struggles and triumphs. They're reminders that this path we're on? We're not walking it alone. Every step you take toward recognizing your inherent worth echoes in the steps of others doing the same work.

And that's the thing about rebuilding self-worth – it's both intensely personal and universally human. Whether it's Sarah learning to enjoy things without grading her performance, Marcus reclaiming his right to take up space, Jamie painting their wall yellow, or Alex discovering worth in stillness – these are all different paths leading to the same truth we talked about earlier.

You know what I love about all these stories we just heard? They remind us that rebuilding self-worth isn't some fancy theoretical concept – it's about those small, brave steps we take every single day. So let me share some practical tools that have worked not just for me, but for countless survivors I've connected with over the years.

First up, let's talk about what I call the ""Permission Slip Practice."" Remember how Jamie painted their wall yellow? That's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. Start small – give yourself permission to do one tiny thing each day that your inner critic usually vetoes. Maybe it's wearing that bright shirt you love but think is ""too much,"" or ordering what you actually want at a restaurant instead of the cheapest thing on the menu. Here's the crucial part: when that critical voice pipes up, acknowledge it with ""I hear you, and I'm choosing to do this anyway.""

Now, something that's been absolutely game-changing for many of us is what I've come to call ""Evidence Collection."" Our trauma-trained brains are fantastic at gathering evidence for why we suck – let's use that same skill but flip the script. Every night, write down three things you did that required strength, kindness, or competence. They don't have to be huge – maybe you made your bed, sent that scary email, or helped someone find something at the grocery store. Over time, you're building a concrete case file that challenges that ""I'm worthless"" narrative.

Here's where it gets really interesting – and stick with me on this one because it might sound a bit wild at first. We're going to practice ""Future Self Conversations."" Think about yourself five years from now, having done all this healing work. What would that version of you say to current you? I know, I know, it sounds cheesy as hell, but there's something powerful about stepping outside our current pain and accessing that wider perspective. Your future self knows you survive this. They know you're doing the best you can with what you've got right now.

Let's get physical for a moment – and no, I'm not about to break into an Olivia Newton-John routine, though hey, that might not be a bad healing tool either! I'm talking about using our bodies to reinforce our worth. Try this: stand in front of a mirror (I know, stay with me here), put your hand on your heart, and say one kind thing to yourself. If that feels too intense – and believe me, I get it – start by just placing your hand on your heart and breathing. That's it. You're literally showing up for yourself in a physical way.

Something that's been particularly helpful for folks dealing with perfectionism – and isn't that most of us with CPTSD? – is what I call the ""Good Enough Revolution."" Set a timer for 20 minutes and do something imperfectly on purpose. Draw a wonky picture, write a messy first draft, fold your laundry ""badly."" The goal isn't to do it wrong – it's to prove to yourself that good enough is, well, good enough.

Here's another practice that's been transformative for many of us: the ""Younger Self Check-In."" When you're making decisions or setting boundaries, ask yourself, ""What would little Gregory (or whatever your name is) need right now?"" Sometimes, just that shift in perspective can help us access the compassion we so readily offer others but struggle to give ourselves.

One tool that's particularly useful when we're spiraling into shame is the ""Fact vs. Story"" technique. When you catch yourself thinking ""I'm such a failure,"" pause and separate the facts from the story. Fact: ""I made a mistake at work."" Story: ""I'm a complete failure who'll never succeed at anything."" See the difference? This isn't about toxic positivity – it's about accuracy.

Look, I know these tools might seem simple, maybe even obvious to some of you. But here's the thing about healing from CPTSD – it's not usually the complex strategies that create lasting change. It's the simple practices we return to again and again, like water slowly reshaping rock. It's about creating new neural pathways, and that happens through consistent, gentle practice.

Remember, you don't have to do all of these at once. Pick one that resonates and start there. Maybe it's just the hand-on-heart thing for now. That's perfect. Because rebuilding self-worth isn't about grand gestures – it's about these small moments of choosing ourselves, over and over again, until it starts to feel natural.

In a minute, we'll dive into some additional tools that build on these foundations, but first, I want to emphasize something crucial: there's no timeline for this work. You're not behind, you're not doing it wrong, and you're exactly where you need to be right now.

So here's where things get really interesting - and I mean that in the most practical way possible. You know how we just talked about those foundational pieces? Well, now I want to share some next-level tools that have been absolute game-changers for both me and many of my clients.

One powerful technique I absolutely love is what I call the ""Evidence Journal."" Now, don't roll your eyes at me - I know how that sounds, but stick with me here. When our self-worth has been hammered by trauma, our brains become exceptional at collecting evidence that we're not enough. This journal flips that script. Every day, you write down one tiny piece of evidence that challenges your negative self-belief. And I mean tiny - maybe you remembered to water your plants, or you sent that text you were avoiding, or hell, you just got out of bed. That counts.

What makes this particularly powerful - and this is the part that blew my mind when I first discovered it - is that you're actually rewiring your brain's filtering system. You're teaching it to notice and catalog the good stuff instead of just the shit that confirms your trauma-based beliefs. It's like installing a new operating system, but instead of Windows updates that crash your computer, this one actually works.

Here's another tool that's been revolutionary for many of us: the ""Future Self Dialogue."" Now, I know this might sound a bit woo-woo, but hear me out. Imagine yourself five years from now, having done all this healing work. This version of you has developed solid self-worth. When you're facing a particularly rough moment, you can actually have a conversation with this future self. What would they tell you? What wisdom would they share? It's surprisingly powerful because it helps you access parts of yourself that already know you're worthy - they're just buried under layers of trauma response.

Let me share something personal here. When I first started doing this work, I thought it was complete bullshit. Like, talking to my future self? Come on. But one day, when I was in a particularly dark place, I tried it. And you know what my future self said? He just laughed and said, ""Oh man, I remember this part. It gets so much better."" That simple moment shifted something fundamental for me.

Now, here's a tool that's particularly useful for those moments when you're feeling overwhelmed by shame or self-doubt - what I call the ""Compassion Swap."" When you catch yourself in negative self-talk, pause and ask yourself: ""Would I say this to someone else who's been through what I've been through?"" The answer is almost always no. Then, take whatever compassionate response you would offer to another person and direct it toward yourself. It feels weird at first, like wearing someone else's shoes, but it gets more natural with practice.

Something that pairs really well with this is what I call ""Permission Slips."" And yes, I literally mean writing yourself permission slips. Permission to rest, to make mistakes, to not have it all figured out. Permission to take up space, to have needs, to set boundaries. It might seem silly, but there's something powerful about physically writing out ""I give myself permission to..."" It's like your brain goes, ""Oh, wait, this is official now.""

Let's talk about something that's often overlooked - the role of the body in rebuilding self-worth. Trauma lives in our bodies, and sometimes the fastest way to shift our sense of worth is through physical practices. This could be as simple as standing in what Amy Cuddy calls a ""power pose"" for two minutes, or as involved as regular movement practices that help you reclaim your relationship with your body.

The key with all these tools is to approach them with curiosity rather than pressure. Think of them as experiments. Some will work brilliantly for you, others might not resonate at all, and that's perfectly okay. Your healing journey is uniquely yours, and part of building self-worth is trusting your own experience of what works for you.

Remember, you're not just doing these practices to feel better in the moment - though that's certainly valuable. You're actually rewiring neural pathways that were shaped by trauma. Each time you use one of these tools, you're laying down new neural tracks, creating alternative pathways to the ones carved by trauma. It's like you're building a whole new network of roads in your brain, and over time, these new routes become the ones you naturally take.

Let's explore how to integrate these tools into daily life in a way that feels sustainable and authentic to you...

You know what I love about this journey of rebuilding self-worth? It's that moment when you start to notice the small shifts – those tiny victories that add up to something profound. Like when you catch yourself standing a little taller in the grocery store, or speaking up in a meeting without that familiar knot in your stomach. These aren't just random occurrences; they're evidence of your nervous system rewiring itself, creating new patterns of self-belief.

I had a beautiful email from Sarah last week that really drove this home. She wrote about how she used to apologize for literally everything – even when someone else bumped into her cart at the store. But after six months of practicing the tools we've discussed, she caught herself mid-sorry and thought, ""Wait, I actually didn't do anything wrong here."" That's the kind of shit that makes me want to do a happy dance, folks. That's integration in action.

Here's what I want you to remember as you move forward: this isn't about becoming a completely different person. It's about uncovering who you've always been beneath the layers of trauma responses and protective mechanisms. Think of it like archaeological work – gentle, patient, and deeply respectful of what you find.

And speaking of gentle, let's talk about the pace of this work. I know some of you are sitting there thinking, ""Greg, I've been doing all these exercises, but I still feel like shit sometimes."" First off, welcome to the club – we meet on Thursdays and there's cookies. But seriously, healing isn't linear. Some days you'll feel like a self-worth warrior, and others you'll want to hide under your blankets and binge-watch The Great British Bake Off. Both are perfectly valid responses.

The key is to keep showing up for yourself, even when it feels like you're taking two steps forward and one step back. Remember those neural pathways we talked about? They're like footpaths in a forest – the more you walk them, the clearer and easier to follow they become. But occasionally, you'll still trip over a root or get your foot stuck in the mud. That's not failure; that's just part of the journey.

As we wrap up today's episode, I want you to take a moment to acknowledge how far you've come. Whether you're just starting to explore these concepts or you've been working on them for years, you're here. You're listening. You're doing the work. That alone is worth celebrating.

Next week, we're diving into a topic that's intimately connected to self-worth: finding peace through forgiveness. And before anyone breaks out in hives, no, this isn't about forcing yourself to forgive everyone who's hurt you. It's about understanding how forgiveness – both of others and ourselves – can be a powerful tool in our healing journey.

Until then, keep being gentle with yourself. Keep practicing these tools in ways that feel authentic to you. And remember, you're not alone in this work. There's a whole community of us out here, making sense of our shit together, one day at a time.

Next episode will be Managing Energy Levels with CPTSD	PUBLISHED			"Hey there, fellow trauma warriors and healing hearts. I'm Gregory, and you've found your way to ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" Today, we're diving deep into something that might make some of you want to throw your phone across the room - forgiveness. Now, before you hit that stop button, I want you to know that I get it. The very word can feel like salt in an open wound, especially when well-meaning people toss it around like confetti at a parade.

But here's the thing - we're not talking about that superficial ""forgive and forget"" bullshit that everyone seems to push. We're going to explore what real forgiveness means for those of us carrying complex trauma, and how it can actually become a pathway to peace - on our own terms, in our own time.

In today's episode, we're going to unpack this complicated beast from every angle. I'll share some stories from our community that might sound eerily familiar - stories of struggling with forgiveness, of wrestling with whether it's even possible, and yes, stories of finding unexpected peace along the way. We'll look at what the latest trauma research tells us about forgiveness and its role in healing, and I'll give you some practical tools that don't require you to compromise your boundaries or invalidate your experiences.

You know me - I'm all about the real talk and practical shit that actually works. So we'll explore techniques that honor where you're at right now, whether that's white-hot anger or numbing confusion. And because I know this topic can be triggering as hell, I'll guide you through some grounding exercises we can use together if things get heavy.

By the end of this episode, my hope is that you'll have a new perspective on what forgiveness can mean for you - not as an obligation or a betrayal of your truth, but as a potential tool in your healing journey. And remember, you're in the driver's seat here. You get to decide what forgiveness looks like in your life, if you choose to explore it at all.

You know what? Before we dive deeper into this forgiveness journey, let's take a moment to check in with our bodies. Yeah, I know - some of you might be rolling your eyes right now thinking, ""Oh great, here comes the woo-woo stuff."" But hey, I promise this isn't about burning sage or chanting mantras - unless that's your thing, in which case, rock on!

Take a slow breath with me. Just notice where you are right now. Maybe you're driving, doing dishes, or hiding in your bathroom for a few minutes of peace - wherever you are, that's perfect. Let's just notice what's happening in our bodies as we've been talking about forgiveness.

Some of you might be feeling a tightness in your chest, or maybe your shoulders are trying to become earrings - I know mine sometimes do. Others might be noticing that familiar knot in your stomach, or perhaps your jaw is doing that clenching thing it does when we touch on heavy topics. All of that is completely normal and exactly where you need to be right now.

Take another breath with me - this time, let's make it a little deeper. Feel your belly expand like a balloon. And as you exhale, see if you can let your shoulders drop just a tiny bit. No pressure to change anything - we're just noticing what's here.

You know what's wild? Our bodies hold onto these stories of hurt and betrayal just as much as our minds do. When we talk about forgiveness, our nervous systems might be sending up all sorts of red flags saying, ""Whoa there, buddy - this feels dangerous!"" That's your survival brain doing its job, protecting you like it always has.

Here's something I want you to remember - and maybe place a hand on your heart if that feels okay: Your body's reactions are valid. They're not ""too much"" or ""too sensitive."" They're the perfectly natural response of someone who's been through some serious shit and survived.

As we continue this conversation, keep checking in with yourself. If you need to pause, pause. If you need to move, move. If you need to scream into a pillow - well, maybe warn your roommates first, but go for it. This is your healing journey, and your body gets a say in how it unfolds.

Take one more breath with me. Nice and easy. Feel your feet on the floor, or whatever's supporting you right now. You're here, you're safe, and you're doing important work just by showing up for yourself.

You know, I want to take us a bit deeper into something that often gets misunderstood about forgiveness - especially when we're dealing with complex trauma. Here's the thing: forgiveness isn't about letting anyone off the hook or saying what happened was okay. God, no. It's about finally letting go of the burning coal we've been holding onto, thinking it would somehow hurt the person who hurt us.

I remember sitting in my therapist's office, practically spitting with rage when she first brought up forgiveness. I was like, ""Are you fucking kidding me? After what they did?"" And she just sat there, calm as could be, and said something that changed everything for me. She said, ""Gregory, forgiveness isn't for them. It's for the part of you that's exhausted from carrying all this.""

Let that sink in for a moment. Because here's what I've learned - and what I see in so many of our community members' stories - we often confuse forgiveness with reconciliation. They're not the same thing at all. You can forgive someone and still never want to see their face again. You can forgive and still maintain those boundaries that keep you safe and sane.

Sometimes, the person we most need to forgive is ourselves. That little kid inside who didn't know how to stop the bad things from happening. That teenager who developed survival mechanisms that don't serve us anymore. That adult who's still beating themselves up for not ""getting over it"" faster.

I had this moment - and I'm getting a little vulnerable here - where I realized I was spending more energy hating my abuser than I was loving myself. That shit stopped me in my tracks. Because that meant they were still taking up prime real estate in my head, rent-free. And I don't know about you, but I got tired of being their landlord.

Now, this isn't some quick fix where you just say ""I forgive"" and suddenly everything's sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes it's more like... imagine you're untangling a massive knot of Christmas lights. You work on one section, make some progress, find another tangle, work on that. It's a process, and it happens in its own time.

And you know what? Sometimes we're not ready to forgive, and that's okay too. Forcing forgiveness before you're ready is like trying to heal a broken bone before it's been properly set - it just doesn't work, and it might even cause more damage.

What I've found most helpful is starting with small acts of self-forgiveness. Maybe you forgive yourself for that awkward thing you said three years ago that still keeps you up at night. Or for not standing up to that toxic friend sooner. Baby steps, right?

The real power move? It's when you realize that forgiveness isn't about erasing the past - it's about creating space for your future. It's about saying, ""Yeah, that happened, and it sucked, and it wasn't okay, but I'm not letting it define every moment of my life going forward.""

Because here's the truth bomb - holding onto unforgiveness is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. And I don't know about you, but I've spent enough time poisoning myself. I'm ready to put down that cup and pick up something that actually nourishes me.

Remember, my fellow trauma warriors, this isn't about rushing the process or forcing anything. It's about giving yourself permission to heal in whatever way feels right for you. And sometimes, that means taking the long way home. That's okay. You've got time, and you've got us right here with you.

So let's try something together right now - a gentle practice that might help you start exploring forgiveness in a way that feels safe and manageable. I want you to get comfortable wherever you are, and if you're driving or can't close your eyes, that's totally cool - just soften your gaze a bit.

Take a few breaths, and I want you to think of something really small that you're holding onto - not the big heavy stuff, we're not going there yet. Maybe it's being annoyed at yourself for forgetting to buy milk, or that time last week when you snapped at your cat. Something tiny that carries just a whisper of that self-judgment we're so good at.

Now, here's where it gets interesting - imagine that same scenario, but pretend it's your best friend telling you about it. They forgot the milk, they had a grumpy moment with their pet. Notice how your perspective probably shifts automatically. That warmth, that understanding you'd offer them without hesitation - that's what we're aiming to redirect toward ourselves.

Sit with that contrast for a moment. Feel the difference between how you judge yourself and how you'd comfort a friend. No need to force anything to change - just notice. This is what I call the ""friendship mirror,"" and it's a powerful tool for beginning to soften that harsh inner voice.

You might notice some resistance coming up - that's normal. Your brain might be throwing out thoughts like ""But I should have known better"" or ""It's different when it's me."" Just let those thoughts float by like leaves on a stream. We see them, we acknowledge them, but we don't need to grab onto them.

Try bringing in that friend-energy toward yourself, just for this one small thing. Maybe place a hand on your heart if that feels right, and whisper whatever words of kindness you'd offer to someone else. ""Hey, it's okay. You're human. These things happen.""

Notice what happens in your body as you do this. There might be tension, there might be relief, there might be nothing at all. Whatever shows up is perfectly fine. This isn't about getting it ""right"" - it's about practicing a new way of being with ourselves.

Let's stay here for just another breath or two, holding ourselves in that same gentle space we so naturally create for others. This is the seed of self-forgiveness - this simple act of extending the same grace to ourselves that we so freely give to others.

When you're ready, bring your attention back to the room, knowing you can return to this practice anytime. It might feel awkward or even silly at first - that's totally normal. We're rewiring some pretty deep patterns here, and like any new skill, it takes practice. But each time you choose this gentler path, you're laying down new neural pathways of self-compassion.

Let me share another practice that's been a game-changer for so many in our community - I call it the ""Future Self Letter."" Now, before you roll your eyes thinking this sounds like some cheesy self-help exercise, hear me out. This one hits different, especially for those of us dealing with CPTSD.

Here's what we're going to do: I want you to imagine yourself five years from now, having done the work of forgiveness - not for others, but for your own peace. This future version of you sits down to write a letter back to present-day you. What would they want you to know about the journey? What wisdom would they share about the weight you're carrying right now?

The magic of this practice is that it creates emotional distance while maintaining connection. When we're stuck in the thick of our pain, it's like trying to read a book with our nose pressed against the pages - we can't make out the words. But this future perspective gives us just enough space to see the bigger picture.

You know what's fascinating? When I do this exercise with clients, they often find their future self is much more compassionate than their present self. It's like we instinctively know how to be gentle with our past selves, even if we struggle to extend that same kindness to ourselves right now.

Take about fifteen minutes with this. Find a quiet spot - maybe grab your favorite beverage, whatever helps you feel grounded. Start writing, ""Dear ,"" and just let your future self speak. They might talk about the peace they've found, how the sharp edges of old wounds have softened, or what became possible once they set down the heavy backpack of unforgiveness.

Something profound happens in this process - you're literally creating a bridge between who you are now and who you're becoming. And here's the kicker: that wise, compassionate future self? They're not some fantasy version of you. They're already in there, just waiting to be heard.

I remember when I first tried this, I was skeptical as hell. But what came out on that page surprised me - it was like accessing a part of myself that already knew the way through. And that's what I want for you - to tap into that wisdom that's already yours.

Don't worry about perfect grammar or making it sound pretty. This isn't for anyone else's eyes. Just let it flow, and notice what comes up. Sometimes the most healing insights arrive in the most unexpected packages.

You know what I've noticed after working with forgiveness for so many years? The real magic happens in those tiny moments when we least expect it. Like when you're doing something completely mundane – maybe folding laundry or waiting for coffee to brew – and suddenly you realize that memory that used to feel like a knife to the gut... it just doesn't hurt the same way anymore.

That's integration happening right there. It's not about having some massive breakthrough or suddenly becoming this enlightened being who never gets triggered. It's about these small shifts adding up over time, like water slowly smoothing out rough stones in a river.

Here's what I want you to remember as you move forward with this: You don't have to force yourself to forgive anyone today. Or tomorrow. Or next year. What matters is that you're showing up for yourself, creating space for whatever needs to surface, and treating yourself with the same compassion you'd offer a dear friend who's been through hell.

Maybe start with forgiving yourself for taking so long to forgive yourself. Yeah, I know – meta as fuck, right? But seriously, that's often where the deepest healing begins. And if you're sitting there thinking ""Greg, this all sounds great but I'm not there yet"" – that's perfectly okay too. You're exactly where you need to be on your journey.

Remember that forgiveness isn't a destination – it's more like learning to dance with your experiences. Some days you'll step on your own toes, other days you'll find your rhythm, and that's all part of the process. Just keep showing up, keep breathing, keep making space for whatever emerges.

Next episode will be The Power of Visualization in Trauma Healing	PUBLISHED			"Hey there, fellow trauma travelers and resilient souls. It's Gregory here, and I'm so damn grateful you've joined me today for another episode where we make sense of this wild CPTSD journey together. You know, I've been thinking a lot about something that comes up constantly in our community – this exhausting dance we do with our energy levels when we're dealing with CPTSD.

Listen, if you've ever found yourself completely drained by what others call ""simple tasks,"" or if you've experienced those frustrating cycles where you're either bouncing off the walls or can barely lift your head from the pillow – you're not alone, and you're definitely not broken. Today, we're diving deep into understanding and managing our energy levels when CPTSD is part of our daily reality.

I'm especially excited about this episode because it's something that hits close to home for me. Just yesterday, I had one of those moments where making breakfast felt like climbing Mount Everest, and I know many of you get exactly what I mean. The thing is, when we're dealing with trauma responses, our nervous system is working overtime – it's like running a high-performance car in first gear, and yeah, that shit gets exhausting.

Throughout this episode, we're going to unpack this complex relationship between CPTSD and our energy levels. I'll be sharing some real stories from our community – because let's face it, sometimes hearing someone else's experience helps us feel less alone in our own struggle. We'll look at what the latest research tells us about why our energy can feel so mercurial, and I'll share some practical tools that have helped both me and many of my clients find a more sustainable way to manage our energy.

But here's what makes today's episode special – we're not just going to talk about the problems. We're going to explore actionable strategies that actually work in the real world, not just in theory. I'm talking about techniques you can start using today, even when you're feeling completely depleted. And don't worry, I promise to keep it real – no toxic positivity or ""just push through it"" bullshit here.

By the end of our time together, you'll have a better understanding of your energy patterns, some practical tools for managing your resources, and most importantly, the validation that your experience is real and worthy of attention. So grab your favorite comfort beverage, find a cozy spot, and let's dive into making sense of this energy puzzle together. Because remember, understanding is the first step toward healing, and you deserve to feel more in control of your energy levels.

You know, I had this moment last week that really hit home for me. I was sitting at my desk, staring at my to-do list, and I felt like I was trying to run a marathon while wearing concrete shoes. That bone-deep exhaustion that comes with CPTSD? Yeah, it was having a party in my body, and I definitely wasn't invited.

And it got me thinking about how many of us struggle with this energy thing. It's like we're all walking around with these invisible battery packs that operate completely differently from everyone else's. Some days we're firing on all cylinders, and then – bam! – out of nowhere, we're running on empty, and the simplest tasks feel like climbing Mount Everest.

Here's what's wild about managing energy with CPTSD: it's not just about being tired. Oh no, that would be too simple, right? It's this complex dance between our nervous system, our emotional bandwidth, and the constant hypervigilance that many of us carry around like an unwanted security blanket. Sometimes I joke that my nervous system is like that overprotective parent who never lets you do anything fun – except instead of stopping me from going to parties, it's stopping me from having consistent energy levels.

Let me paint you a picture of what this often looks like. You wake up feeling decent, maybe even good. You make plans, you start tackling your day, and then suddenly – usually right when you need your energy the most – your body decides it's done. Not just ""I need a coffee"" done, but ""I might need to lie down on this floor right now"" done. And the kicker? There's often no obvious trigger. It's like your body's playing energy roulette, and you never know where that ball's gonna land.

What makes this especially tricky is that society isn't exactly set up for people with fluctuating energy levels. We're expected to maintain this consistent level of productivity, to ""push through"" and ""just do it."" But when you're dealing with CPTSD, pushing through isn't always an option – and honestly, it's not always the healthiest choice either.

I remember this one time I tried to power through when my energy was tanking. I was at a work event, doing my best to network and be ""on,"" even though my body was screaming at me to get out of there. By the time I got home, I was so depleted that I couldn't function for three days straight. That's when I realized that managing energy isn't about forcing ourselves to keep going – it's about learning to work with our bodies instead of against them.

The thing that really gets me is how many of us feel shame around this. We beat ourselves up for not being able to maintain the same energy levels as others, for having to cancel plans, for needing more rest than seems ""normal."" But here's the truth bomb I want to drop right now: your energy challenges are not a character flaw. They're a very real, very valid response to trauma, and understanding this is crucial for learning how to work with them rather than against them.

You know what's fascinating? Our bodies are actually trying to protect us with these energy fluctuations. It's like having an overenthusiastic bodyguard who sometimes misreads the situation. When we understand this, we can start to work with our energy patterns instead of feeling betrayed by them.

I've spent years learning to navigate this energy maze, and I've got to tell you – it's been quite the journey. There have been moments of frustration where I wanted to throw my hands up and scream at the unfairness of it all. But there have also been breakthrough moments, those little victories where I finally understood a pattern or found a strategy that actually worked.

That's exactly why I wanted to dive into this topic today. Because managing energy levels with CPTSD isn't just about finding ways to have more energy – though that's certainly part of it. It's about understanding our unique energy patterns, learning to honor our bodies' signals, and developing strategies that work with our nervous systems instead of against them.

As we move forward in today's episode, we're going to explore this from all angles – the science behind it, practical strategies that actually work, and most importantly, how to make peace with our energy needs. Because at the end of the day, this isn't about fitting into some standardized mold of how we ""should"" function. It's about creating a sustainable way of living that honors our experiences and supports our healing journey.

So let's really dig into what's happening when our energy tanks hit empty, because this is where a lot of us get stuck in some pretty gnarly shame spirals. You know those moments - when you're lying on the couch, staring at the ceiling, and that inner critic starts up with its greatest hits: ""Everyone else can handle this,"" or ""You're just being lazy."" Yeah, I've been there too, and let me tell you something important - that voice is full of shit.

Here's what's actually going on in our bodies when we're dealing with CPTSD energy crashes. Our nervous systems have basically been running a marathon while trying to convince everyone (including ourselves) that we're just out for a casual jog. The hypervigilance alone - that constant scanning for threats that most of us don't even realize we're doing - burns through energy like you wouldn't believe. It's like having fifty browser tabs open in your brain, all running complex programs, all the time.

Now, something I noticed in my own journey - and I see this with so many of my clients - is that we often try to push through these energy dips like we're still in survival mode. It's this weird paradox where we're using survival strategies to try to heal from survival mode. Makes about as much sense as trying to put out a fire with gasoline, right?

Let me share something that happened to me last week. I had this perfectly planned day - you know, the kind where you think you've finally got your shit together. But by noon, I could feel that familiar energy crash coming on. The old me would have powered through, probably with enough coffee to give a rhino the jitters. Instead, I did something that still feels radical: I listened to my body. I took a twenty-minute rest - not even a nap, just quiet time with my eyes closed. And you know what? The world didn't end. In fact, I got more done in the afternoon than I typically would forcing myself to push through.

This brings me to something really important about energy management with CPTSD - it's not just about physical energy. We're dealing with emotional energy, mental energy, and what I like to call ""people energy."" That last one's especially tricky for those of us with trauma backgrounds because social interactions often require extra processing power. It's like running your phone's GPS, camera, and three social media apps all at once - your battery's gonna drain faster than normal.

But here's where it gets interesting - and I really want you to hear this - your energy needs aren't a character flaw. They're not something to fix or overcome. They're valuable information from your body about what you need to feel safe and functional. When we start treating these signals with curiosity instead of judgment, something remarkable happens: we start developing a more nuanced understanding of our own rhythms.

Think of it like this: if you were caring for a small child who was exhausted, would you berate them for needing rest? Would you force them to keep going until they collapsed? Of course not. Yet somehow, we've internalized this idea that showing ourselves the same basic compassion is somehow wrong or weak.

Let's talk about what I call the ""energy debt cycle."" It's this pattern where we push ourselves way past our limits, crash hard, feel shame about crashing, then try to make up for lost time by pushing even harder. Sound familiar? Yeah, it's about as sustainable as trying to pay off one credit card with another. The interest just keeps compounding until we're emotionally bankrupt.

The shift happens when we start working with our energy patterns instead of against them. This isn't about lowering our standards or giving up on our goals - it's about being strategic with the energy we have. Sometimes that means doing less but doing it more consistently. Sometimes it means scheduling rest before we need it, which feels counterintuitive as hell when you're used to running on empty.

I had a client who used to pride herself on working twelve-hour days, until she realized she was spending her weekends in a dissociative fog just trying to recover. When she started building in regular breaks and actually honoring her body's needs, her overall productivity actually increased. More importantly, she started feeling more present in her own life.

The thing is, managing energy with CPTSD isn't just about finding the right productivity hack or wellness routine. It's about fundamentally changing our relationship with rest and activity. It's about understanding that our needs might look different from other people's needs, and that's okay. It's about recognizing that sometimes the most productive thing we can do is absolutely nothing.

And let me tell you, this isn't some quick fix situation. It's more like learning a new language - at first, everything feels awkward and confusing, and you make a lot of mistakes. But gradually, you start to understand the subtle signals your body's been trying to send you all along. You begin to recognize the difference between productive tiredness and trauma exhaustion. You learn to spot the early warning signs of energy depletion before you hit crisis mode.

This is where the real healing happens - not in pushing ourselves harder, but in learning to work with our natural rhythms and needs. It's about building a sustainable relationship with our energy that supports our healing instead of depleting it.

So here's where the science gets really fascinating, my friends. When we look at the research around energy management and CPTSD, we're seeing some groundbreaking studies that validate what many of us have experienced firsthand. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's work, particularly in ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" shows us how trauma literally changes our body's energy systems at a cellular level. It's not just in our heads – our bodies are actually working differently.

Let me share something that blew my mind when I first learned about it. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Affective Disorders found that people with CPTSD have significantly altered cortisol patterns compared to those without trauma histories. Think about that for a second. Our stress hormone system – you know, the one that's supposed to give us energy when we need it and help us rest when we don't – it's operating on a completely different schedule. No wonder we sometimes feel like we're running on empty when others seem fine.

And here's where it gets even more interesting. Research from the National Institute of Mental Health shows that trauma survivors often experience what they call ""allostatic load"" – basically, the wear and tear on your body from chronic stress. It's like running your car in the red zone all the time. The engine might keep going, but something's eventually gonna give.

 

You know, sometimes when I'm sharing this research, I can feel people thinking, ""Great, Gregory, more bad news."" But hold on – here's where hope comes in. A 2020 study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress showed that implementing regular energy management techniques – like the ones we talked about earlier – can actually help regulate these systems over time. Our bodies have this amazing capacity to heal and adapt.

Dr. Stephen Porges – yeah, the polyvagal theory guy – his research shows how we can actually train our nervous system to better regulate energy. It's like having a thermostat that's been stuck on high, and slowly learning to adjust it back to a comfortable temperature. The science suggests that consistent, gentle practices are more effective than trying to force massive changes all at once.

Now, I want to share something really exciting from a 2021 study in Frontiers in Psychology. They found that trauma survivors who implemented regular ""energy check-ins"" – basically, what we've been talking about with monitoring our battery levels – showed significant improvements in their daily functioning within just eight weeks. Eight weeks! That's not a lifetime; that's like two months of Netflix subscription.

But here's the kicker – and this is important – the same study showed that the participants who tried to push through their fatigue actually experienced setbacks. The research confirms what we've been saying: forcing yourself to ""power through"" isn't just unhelpful; it's counterproductive.

You know what really gets me excited? The emerging research on chronobiology and trauma. Scientists are finding that each of us has unique energy patterns – they call it our ""chronotype."" When we work with these natural patterns instead of against them, we see better outcomes in trauma healing. It's like finally reading the user manual for your own body.

A fascinating study from the University of Michigan showed that trauma survivors who aligned their high-energy tasks with their natural peak times reported 40% better outcomes in their therapy work. Forty percent! That's not a small number, friends. That's the difference between feeling like you're drowning and feeling like you might actually get your head above water.

And let's talk about something that doesn't get enough attention – the research on social energy and trauma. A 2022 study in the Journal of Psychiatric Research found that trauma survivors often spend up to three times more energy in social situations than others. No wonder we feel wiped out after what others consider ""simple"" social interactions. It's not in your head – you're literally using more energy.

Here's something particularly relevant for our community: research from the Complex Trauma Foundation shows that implementing energy management strategies can reduce dissociative episodes by up to 60%. That's huge. When we honor our energy needs, we're not just feeling better – we're actually changing how our nervous system responds to stress.

The science is clear on one thing: sustainable energy management isn't about pushing harder or doing more. It's about working smarter with the energy we have. Studies consistently show that small, consistent adjustments are more effective than dramatic overhauls that we can't maintain.

And you know what? This research validates what many of us have felt intuitively. When the studies show that trauma survivors need more recovery time between activities, it's not because we're weak – it's because our systems are working overtime to process and heal. Understanding this can help us be more compassionate with ourselves and make choices that actually support our healing journey.

Remember, these studies aren't just abstract numbers – they're roadmaps showing us how to work with our bodies instead of against them. They're telling us that when we honor our energy needs, we're not being lazy or difficult – we're being scientifically sound in our approach to healing.

Now, here's where things get really interesting – and I want to share something that blew my mind when I first understood it. You know how we've been talking about energy management? Well, there's this fascinating connection between our energy levels and what I like to call our ""trauma clock.""

Think about it like this: Many of us with CPTSD have spent years, maybe decades, operating on someone else's schedule. Whether it was an unpredictable parent, an demanding partner, or a toxic work environment, we learned to override our natural rhythms to survive. And let me tell you, that shit takes a toll.

I remember this one time – and I'm laughing about it now – when I tried to force myself to be a ""morning person"" because that's what successful people supposedly do, right? Holy shit, was that a disaster. My body was literally screaming ""No, dude, this isn't your rhythm!"" But I kept pushing because I thought that's what healing looked like.

Here's the deeper truth I've discovered: Our energy patterns are often directly linked to our trauma responses. Some of us might experience energy spikes in the evening because that's when we had to be most vigilant as kids. Others might crash in the afternoon because that's when we used to hide to stay safe. These aren't random patterns – they're adaptive responses that served a purpose.

But here's where it gets really powerful – and I want you to really hear this part. Once we understand these patterns, we can start working with them instead of against them. It's like having a secret decoder ring for your energy levels. And no, I'm not suggesting we stay trapped in these trauma-based patterns forever, but understanding them is the first step to transforming them.

Let me share something that happened with one of my clients – we'll call her Sarah. She used to beat herself up constantly because she couldn't maintain consistent energy throughout the day. She'd have these intense productive bursts followed by what she called ""zombie hours."" Through our work together, we discovered that her energy dips corresponded exactly to the times when, as a child, she had to be ""invisible"" to avoid her father's rage. Mind-blowing, right?

The real breakthrough came when she stopped fighting these patterns and started planning around them. She scheduled her most demanding tasks during her natural energy peaks and used her lower-energy periods for gentle, nurturing activities. And you know what? Her overall energy actually improved because she wasn't constantly fighting against her body's natural rhythm.

This brings me to something I call the ""Energy Recovery Protocol"" – and no, it's not some fancy trademarked system. It's simply about learning to read and respond to your body's signals before you hit empty. Think of it like having a fuel gauge that actually works, instead of driving until you're running on fumes and praying for a gas station.

Here's what's fascinating about this: When we start honoring these energy patterns, other aspects of our healing journey often fall into place. Sleep often improves, anxiety levels decrease, and we start feeling more in tune with ourselves. It's like our bodies go, ""Finally! You're listening to me!""

But – and this is crucial – this isn't about accepting limitations. It's about understanding your current energy landscape so you can gradually reshape it. It's like being an energy archaeologist, excavating these patterns with curiosity rather than judgment.

I've noticed in my own journey that some days I have what I call ""trauma weather"" – those days when my energy seems to be affected by invisible storms from the past. Instead of fighting it, I've learned to work with it. Sometimes that means adjusting my schedule, sometimes it means extra self-care, and sometimes it just means acknowledging, ""Yep, this is one of those days"" and being gentle with myself.

The really beautiful part about this approach is how it ripples out into other areas of healing. When we get better at managing our energy, we often find we're better equipped to handle emotional regulation, boundary setting, and even interpersonal relationships. It's like building a solid foundation that supports everything else.

And let's be real for a moment – this isn't always easy. There will be days when life demands more than we feel we have to give. But having this deeper understanding of our energy patterns gives us options. It helps us make informed choices about when to push through and when to pull back.

Remember that client Sarah I mentioned earlier? She eventually developed what she called her ""energy wisdom"" – this incredible ability to anticipate and prepare for energy fluctuations. She stopped seeing her patterns as problems to fix and started viewing them as information to guide her healing journey. And that's really what this is all about – developing your own energy wisdom, your own unique way of working with rather than against your body's natural rhythms.

Because here's the truth: Your energy patterns tell a story. They're not random, they're not wrong, and they're definitely not a sign of weakness. They're valuable information about your journey, your needs, and your healing process.

You know what really drives this point home for me? The incredible stories I hear from our community members. Like Sarah, who wrote to me last week about her journey with energy management. She said, ""Gregory, for years I thought I was just lazy because I couldn't maintain the same pace as everyone else. Turns out I was trying to run a marathon with a sprained ankle – my trauma was the injury I couldn't see.""

Man, that hit me right in the feels. And Sarah's story gets even more interesting. She discovered that her energy crashes weren't random at all – they were perfectly timed with anniversary dates of her trauma, even when she wasn't consciously aware of the connection. Once she started tracking her patterns, she could prepare for these dips instead of beating herself up about them.

Then there's Marcus, whose story I think will resonate with many of you. He works in tech, and for years he tried to match his coworkers' energy levels, pushing through 12-hour days and wondering why he felt like he was dying inside. Here's what he shared: ""I realized I was spending so much energy just keeping myself regulated in the office environment – the fluorescent lights, the constant interruptions, the pressure to be 'on' all the time – that I had nothing left for actual work, let alone my personal life.""

What Marcus did next was fucking brilliant, if you ask me. He negotiated a hybrid work schedule, using his high-energy morning hours at home for focused work, and going to the office only during his more stable afternoon periods. His productivity actually increased, and – this is the kicker – his trauma symptoms decreased because he wasn't constantly depleting his energy reserves.

Oh, and I have to share Alex's story because it shows how creative we can get with this stuff. Alex is a parent with CPTSD who struggled with the constant demands of caregiving. They wrote, ""I felt like the worst parent ever because I couldn't maintain the energy to be 'fun mom' all the time."" But instead of forcing themselves to push through, they created what they call 'energy pockets' throughout the day.

These energy pockets are genius – Alex scheduled high-energy activities with their kids during their natural energy peaks, and introduced ""quiet adventure time"" during their lower periods. They turned rest into a game, teaching their kids about different animals that hibernate or rest, making it normal and natural. How beautiful is that?

And listen to this one – this email from Jamie really stuck with me. They described their energy levels like a cell phone battery that starts each day at 40% instead of 100%. Jamie wrote, ""Once I accepted this was my reality, I could stop trying to operate like I had a full charge. Instead, I got really strategic about where I spent my energy, like closing unnecessary apps on your phone to save battery life.""

Jamie's metaphor is spot on, isn't it? And it leads to something I hear a lot in our community – this idea that managing energy isn't just about rest versus activity. Raj, another listener, shared how they discovered that certain activities actually gave them energy rather than depleting it. ""It's like some activities run on solar power,"" they wrote, ""while others drain the battery.""

For Raj, sitting in a coffee shop working on their art projects actually energized them, while sitting at home watching TV – which they thought would be restful – often left them feeling more depleted. It's such a powerful reminder that rest and recovery look different for everyone.

Then there's Pat's story, which I think perfectly illustrates how managing energy levels isn't just about the big stuff. Pat started paying attention to micro-interactions and their energy impact. They noticed that a 10-minute phone call with their mother could deplete their energy more than a two-hour work meeting. Once they had this awareness, they could plan accordingly – scheduling those challenging interactions when they had the energy reserves to handle them.

You know what all these stories have in common? They show that managing energy isn't about fixing ourselves or forcing our bodies to conform to some arbitrary standard. It's about listening, adapting, and honoring our unique needs.

I particularly love what Lin wrote about this: ""I used to think healing meant I would eventually have 'normal' energy levels. Now I understand that healing means working with my energy patterns, not against them. Some days I'm a sporadic burst of sunshine, other days I'm a slow-burning candle – and both are perfectly okay.""

And can we talk about Maya's breakthrough? She discovered that her energy crashes weren't just about physical or mental fatigue – they were often emotional weather forecasts. ""When I feel my energy suddenly tank,"" she wrote, ""it's usually a sign that I'm about to process something big. Instead of fighting it, I now see it as my psyche's way of clearing the schedule for important internal work.""

These stories remind me that we're all scientists in our own healing laboratories, conducting experiments and gathering data about what works for us. Sometimes these experiments fail spectacularly – like when Dee tried to schedule all their challenging tasks for Monday mornings because that's when they thought they should be most productive. Spoiler alert: it didn't work. But that failure led them to discover that their energy actually peaks on Wednesday afternoons, and now they plan accordingly.

What strikes me about all these stories is the common thread of self-discovery and self-compassion. Each person had to let go of shoulds and expectations to find their own rhythm. They had to trust their bodies' signals, even when those signals didn't match societal norms or others' expectations.

And isn't that really what this work is all about? Finding our own way, trusting our own experience, and building a life that works with our energy patterns rather than against them. These stories show us that it's possible – not always easy, but definitely possible.

So now that we've heard these powerful stories of people finding their way, let's dig into some practical tools you can start experimenting with today. And I say 'experimenting' very intentionally here, because what works for one person's energy management might not work for another – and that's completely okay.

Let me share one of my favorite techniques first, something I call the ""Energy Weather Report."" You know how we check the weather forecast to plan our day? Well, we can do the same thing with our energy levels. When you wake up, take a moment – just 30 seconds – to notice where your energy is at. Is it stormy and turbulent? Calm and clear? Foggy and uncertain? There's no right or wrong here, folks. We're just gathering information.

Here's the thing about energy forecasting – it helps us make better decisions before we're in the middle of an energy crisis. I remember one client who started doing this and realized that every Wednesday, without fail, her energy would crash around 2 PM. Instead of beating herself up about it, she started scheduling her lighter tasks for that time. Game changer, right?

Now, let's talk about what I call ""energy boundaries."" These are different from regular boundaries because they're specifically about protecting your energy reserves. Think of it like having a phone battery that charges differently than other people's. Maybe yours needs more frequent charging, or maybe it drains faster in certain situations. That's not a defect – it's just how your system works.

One practical way to implement energy boundaries is through what I call the ""Sacred No."" This isn't about being mean or unhelpful – it's about being honest about your energy capacity. When someone asks you to do something, give yourself permission to pause and check your energy forecast. ""Let me check my schedule and get back to you"" is a perfectly valid response, even if you technically have that time slot free.

You know what's funny? Sometimes people tell me they feel guilty about protecting their energy, like it's somehow selfish. But here's a question: If you had a friend who was recovering from major surgery, would you expect them to run a marathon? Of course not! Well, managing CPTSD requires similar respect for your system's needs and limitations.

Let's get into another practical tool: the ""Energy Emergency Kit."" This is something you put together when you're feeling relatively stable, kind of like packing a first aid kit before you need it. What goes in it? Whatever helps regulate your system. Maybe it's a playlist of songs that help you ground, or a soft piece of fabric that feels soothing to touch, or even just a list of simple stretches that help you reconnect with your body.

I've got one client who keeps what she calls her ""energy rescue pack"" in her desk at work. It's just a small bag with some tea, a stress ball, and a photo that makes her smile. But having it there helps her remember that she has tools available when things get overwhelming.

Here's another technique that might sound a bit strange at first, but bear with me: ""Energy Bookending."" This involves creating small rituals at the beginning and end of energy-demanding activities. For example, if you know you have a challenging meeting coming up, you might take five minutes before to do some breathing exercises, and five minutes after to shake it off – literally shake your body if you want to! These bookends help your nervous system understand that you're entering and leaving different energy states.

Now, I want to emphasize something really important here: implementing these tools isn't about becoming some sort of energy management superhero. It's about getting to know your system better and working with it instead of against it. Some days you'll nail it, and other days you'll forget everything you know – and that's perfectly normal.

One thing that's been really helpful for many folks in our community is what I call ""Energy Mapping."" Take a week and just notice when your energy naturally rises and falls throughout the day. Don't try to change anything yet – just observe. Are you sharper in the morning? Do you have a natural dip after lunch? Does your energy pick up in the evening? This information is gold because it helps you structure your day in a way that works with your natural rhythms instead of fighting them.

Remember, we're not trying to fix or change our energy patterns – we're learning to work with them. Think of it like learning to surf. You can't control the waves, but you can learn to read them and work with their natural flow. Sometimes you'll catch a perfect wave, sometimes you'll wipe out, but over time, you get better at reading the conditions and adjusting accordingly.

As we wrap up this part of our practical tools discussion, I want you to remember that implementing these strategies is a practice, not a performance. You're not going to get it perfect right away, and that's absolutely fine. The goal is to start building awareness and gradually incorporate these tools in a way that feels manageable for you.

So, let's dig into some additional tools that have really helped my clients - and honestly, myself - with managing those energy fluctuations we've been talking about. You know what's fascinating? Sometimes the most effective tools are the ones that seem almost too simple at first glance.

Here's something I absolutely love - what I call the ""energy weather report."" Just like you might check the actual weather before planning your day, taking a moment to check in with your energy levels can be incredibly powerful. But here's the twist - instead of just noting if you're tired or energized, try to notice the quality of your energy. Is it buzzy and anxious? Heavy and weighted? Light but scattered? Understanding these nuances helps you respond more effectively.

Now, I had this client - let's call her Maya - who started using what she dubbed her ""energy anchors."" These were specific activities that she knew would either lift her energy or help ground her when she was feeling overwhelmed. For instance, she discovered that five minutes of jumping rope could shift her out of that foggy, dissociated state better than an hour of trying to push through it. On the flip side, when she was feeling wired and anxious, sorting her sock drawer became this weird but effective way to bring her energy down.

Let me share something that might sound a bit out there, but stick with me. I've found that treating your energy like a bank account can be incredibly helpful. Just like you wouldn't expect to keep withdrawing money without making deposits, you can't keep pushing through when your energy is low without finding ways to replenish it. The trick is identifying what actually counts as a deposit for you, because - and this is important - it's not always what you think it should be.

For example, I used to beat myself up for not finding meditation energizing because, you know, that's what all the wellness gurus tell us we should do. But guess what? For some of us with CPTSD, sitting still with our thoughts isn't always the most helpful thing. Sometimes, gentle movement or even organizing a small space can be more replenishing than traditional ""self-care"" activities.

Here's another tool that's been a game-changer for many folks I work with: the energy boundary setting practice. This isn't just about saying ""no"" to things - though that's certainly part of it. It's about recognizing that your energy is precious and finite, and you get to be intentional about how you spend it. Think of it like having a daily energy budget. If you know you have a challenging work meeting in the afternoon, maybe you don't also schedule therapy for that day. It's about working with your patterns, not against them.

And speaking of patterns, let's talk about something I call ""energy momentum."" You know how sometimes it feels impossible to get started on something, but once you're moving, it's easier to keep going? That's energy momentum. The key is to start really small - we're talking ridiculously small. Want to exercise? Start with literally one minute. Need to tackle a big project? Begin with opening the document and writing one sentence. The momentum builds from there.

One thing that's really important to remember - and I cannot stress this enough - is that managing energy levels with CPTSD isn't about achieving some perfect state of consistent energy. That's not realistic or even desirable. Instead, it's about developing a flexible relationship with your energy fluctuations. Think of it like surfing - you're learning to ride the waves rather than trying to control the ocean.

I had this breakthrough moment with a client recently - let's call him James. He was frustrated because he couldn't maintain the same energy level throughout the day like his colleagues seemed to. When we dug deeper, we realized that by accepting his natural energy rhythms and working with them instead of against them, he actually became more productive overall. He started scheduling his most demanding tasks during his natural energy peaks and using his lower energy periods for more routine work.

You know what's really cool? As you practice these tools, you'll start developing what I like to call your ""energy intuition."" It's like having an internal GPS for your energy levels. You'll begin to notice subtle shifts before they become overwhelming, and you'll have a better sense of what interventions work best for different situations. This isn't something that happens overnight - it's more like learning a new language. At first, everything feels clunky and awkward, but gradually, it becomes more natural and intuitive.

You know, as we're wrapping up today's deep dive into energy management, I'm reminded of something a mentor once told me - she said managing energy with CPTSD is like learning to sail. Some days the winds are gentle, other days they're stormy as hell, but gradually we learn to read the conditions and adjust our sails accordingly.

What really strikes me is how this journey is so deeply personal for each of us. Sure, we've covered a lot of practical tools and strategies today, but what matters most is finding your own rhythm, your own way of dancing with these energy fluctuations. It's okay if your process looks different from someone else's - that's actually exactly how it should be.

I want to acknowledge something important here - this work isn't always pretty. Sometimes you'll nail it, feeling like you've got this whole energy management thing figured out, and then boom - life throws you a curveball. That's normal, that's human, and honestly, that's part of the healing journey.

Looking ahead to next week's episode on visualization in trauma healing, we'll explore how these energy management skills can actually enhance our ability to use visualization effectively. They're all connected, these pieces of our healing puzzle.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Every time you notice your energy shifting, every time you make a small adjustment to take care of yourself, you're building that muscle of self-awareness and self-care. That's huge, and I'm genuinely proud of you for showing up for yourself.

It's Gregory here, and I'm so damn glad you've joined me today in this safe space where we make sense of the shit that complex trauma dumps on us. You know, sometimes the heaviest battles we fight are the ones in our own minds, and that's exactly why today's episode is all about something I'm genuinely excited to share with you – the transformative power of visualization in trauma healing.

Listen, I know what some of you might be thinking – ""Gregory, I can barely handle my actual reality, let alone start playing mind movies."" Trust me, I've been there. But here's the thing: visualization isn't some woo-woo bullshit or magical thinking. It's a practical, scientifically-backed tool that's been helping trauma survivors reclaim their sense of safety and control for years.

In today's episode, we're going to dive deep into how visualization can actually rewire our trauma-affected brains. We'll explore why this technique is particularly powerful for those of us dealing with CPTSD, and I'll share some mind-blowing research that explains why imagining safety can feel as real to our nervous system as actually being safe.

You'll hear some incredible stories from our community members who've used visualization to navigate their healing journey – stories that honestly brought tears to my eyes and hope to my heart. And don't worry, I'm not just going to leave you hanging with theory. We'll get into the nitty-gritty of practical visualization techniques that you can start using today, even if you've never done anything like this before.

By the end of this episode, you'll have a solid understanding of how to harness your imagination as a healing tool, along with specific resources and next steps to continue this work on your own terms, at your own pace. Because that's what we do here – we take the overwhelming shit and break it down into manageable pieces that actually make sense.

So grab your favorite comfort item, find a cozy spot, and let's explore how the power of your mind can become one of your strongest allies in healing.

 Before we dive deeper into visualization, let's do what we always do and check in with our bodies for a moment. Yeah, I know some of you are rolling your eyes right now – and that's totally okay. I see you there, thinking ""Greg, not this hippie shit again."" But here's the thing – our bodies are carrying so much of our story, and they deserve a little attention.

Take a breath with me. Not one of those forced, yoga-instructor-style deep breaths – just notice the air moving in and out. Maybe it's shallow, maybe it's deep, maybe it's a bit jagged. Whatever it is, it's perfectly fine. Your breath has gotten you this far, hasn't it?

Now, while keeping that gentle awareness of your breath, let's notice what's happening in your body. I'm doing this right along with you, and I'm noticing that my shoulders are trying to become earrings again.  Maybe you're noticing something similar, or maybe you're realizing your jaw is clenched, or your stomach is tight. Whatever you're discovering – just notice it. No need to fix anything.

Feel where your body is making contact with whatever's supporting you right now. Your chair, your couch, maybe you're lying in bed – hello to my insomnia crew out there. Notice the temperature of the air on your skin. Are your feet warm or cold? Are you fidgeting? That's all information your body is trying to share with you.

If you're noticing tension or discomfort somewhere, you can experiment with letting it soften a tiny bit. Just a small release, like turning down the volume on a radio. And if it doesn't want to soften, that's completely okay too. Sometimes our tension is there for a reason – it's been keeping us safe, and we can respect that.

Take another breath, and maybe wiggle your toes or fingers if you want to. Remember, this isn't about achieving some perfect state of relaxation. It's about building a friendship with your body, learning its language. And just like any friendship, it takes time and patience.

As we move forward into exploring visualization techniques, this body awareness we just practiced will be super helpful. Because visualization isn't just about what happens in our minds – it's a whole-body experience. And now that we've checked in with ourselves, we're better equipped to work with these tools in a way that feels safe and meaningful.

 How are you doing? Take another moment if you need it. There's no rush here. This is your time, and we're all in this together.

 You know what fascinates me most about visualization? It's something we're actually doing all day long without even realizing it. When we're caught in those loops of replaying past trauma or catastrophizing about the future – that's visualization too, just not the kind that serves us. So let's flip that natural ability on its head and make it work for our healing instead.

I remember when I first started practicing intentional visualization, I was skeptical as hell. Like, how is sitting here imagining my ""safe place"" going to help when my nervous system is lighting up like Times Square on New Year's Eve? But here's the wild thing – our brains don't actually know the difference between a vividly imagined experience and a real one. That's why nightmares can leave us sweating and shaking, right?

The game-changer for me was understanding that visualization isn't about forcing yourself to think happy thoughts or pretending everything's fine. It's more like... imagine you're rehearsing for a play, but the play is your own healing journey. You're not denying the existence of the hard stuff; you're just practicing different ways to move through it.

Let me share something that happened just last week. I was working with a client – we'll call her Sarah – who struggled with feeling physically present during therapy sessions. Her go-to response was to dissociate, which, hey, totally makes sense given her history. We started working with a simple visualization where she imagined roots growing from her feet into the earth, just like a tree. Nothing fancy, right? But after a few sessions of practicing this, she noticed she could actually feel her feet on the ground during our conversations. That's the power of this stuff – it creates new neural pathways that become available when we need them most.

Here's where it gets really interesting though. Visualization isn't just about creating peaceful scenes or safe spaces – although those are incredibly valuable tools. It can also be about reimagining our relationship with our trauma responses. Like, what if instead of seeing your hypervigilance as the enemy, you visualized it as an overworked security guard who's just trying to keep you safe? It might sound a bit woo-woo, but this kind of reframing can create profound shifts in how we relate to our symptoms.

And let's be real – some days, visualization might feel impossible. Your mind might be racing so fast it feels like trying to catch lightning in a bottle. That's okay. That's actually really important information about where you're at right now. Maybe on those days, you start with just visualizing your next breath, or the feeling of your hands resting in your lap. Sometimes the smallest steps create the biggest openings.

What I love most about visualization is that it gives us back some agency in our healing process. When so much of trauma is about feeling powerless, having this tool – this ability to actively participate in rewiring our nervous systems – that's revolutionary stuff right there.

And hey, if you're sitting there thinking ""Greg, my mind is way too chaotic for this,"" I hear you. I really do. That's exactly why we start small, why we anchor these practices in our body's wisdom, and why we always, always respect our own timing. Because this isn't about forcing anything – it's about gently opening doors to new possibilities, one visualization at a time.

 So as we sit with this, I want you to know that whatever your experience with visualization has been so far – whether it's been helpful, challenging, or somewhere in between – you're exactly where you need to be. Your journey is your own, and these tools are here to serve you, not the other way around.

Alright, let's put some of this into practice together. I want to guide you through a gentle visualization exercise that I personally find really grounding - and don't worry if your mind wanders or if you're not seeing crystal-clear images. That's totally normal and actually part of the process.

Find a comfortable position, whether you're driving, walking, or sitting somewhere quiet. If it feels safe to close your eyes, go ahead - but keeping them open is perfectly fine too. Take a slow, easy breath, whatever that means for your body right now.

I want you to imagine you're holding a small object - something simple like a leaf or a smooth stone. Notice I'm not telling you what it should be. Your nervous system knows what feels right. Maybe it's something that reminds you of a time you felt peaceful, or maybe it's just something that caught your attention today. 

Take a moment to really feel the weight of this object in your hand. Notice its temperature - is it cool like a stone from a stream, or warm like it's been sitting in the sun? How does the texture feel against your skin? There's no rush here. We're just getting curious about these sensations.

Now, and this is where it gets interesting - imagine this object has the ability to absorb any difficult emotions you're carrying. Maybe it's anxiety, maybe it's that heavy feeling of shame we know so well with CPTSD. Whatever it is, visualize it slowly moving from your body into this object. Some folks see it as a color, others feel it more as a sensation - trust whatever comes up for you.

Here's the thing that makes this practice different - you're in complete control. If at any point this feels too intense, imagine setting the object down. You can pick it up again when you're ready, or leave it be. This is your visualization, your rules.

Take another breath, and if you're still holding your object, imagine placing it somewhere safe. Maybe it's in a stream that carries those difficult emotions away, or maybe you bury it in soft earth where those feelings can transform into something new. Again, trust what feels right for your system.

Before we wrap this up, notice how your body feels now. Maybe there's a slight shift, maybe things feel the same - both are perfectly okay. This practice isn't about dramatic transformations; it's about building a gentle relationship with our inner world.

Remember, you can come back to this visualization anytime. Make it your own. Change the object, change the setting, adjust the pace - whatever serves you best. That's the beauty of this tool - it's completely adaptable to your needs in any given moment.

And if this particular practice didn't quite land for you today? That's absolutely fine. We've got plenty more tools to explore together, and finding what works for you is part of the journey.

So let's explore another visualization practice that I absolutely love - one that's helped me and countless others create a sense of safety when we're feeling overwhelmed. I call it the ""Container of Light,"" and trust me, it's not as woo-woo as it might sound.

You know those moments when everything feels like too much? When memories or emotions are spilling over and you just need some breathing room? That's exactly where this practice comes in handy. And the best part? You can do it anywhere, anytime, without anyone even knowing.

Here's what I've found works well - and remember, you can totally modify this to fit what feels right for you. Start by imagining a gentle, warm light surrounding your body. Some folks picture it like a protective bubble, others like a cocoon of golden light. I personally imagine it like one of those sci-fi force fields, because hey, who doesn't want to feel like they've got some kick-ass personal shields, right?

Now, this is where it gets interesting - and I want you to really play with this part. Imagine this light has specific qualities. Maybe it's like a filter that lets in all the good stuff - support, love, understanding - while keeping out what doesn't serve you right now. Some of my clients imagine it as having a texture - smooth, soft, or even slightly sparkly. Whatever feels protective and comforting to you.

The real magic happens when you start using this container as a boundary tool. When you're in a triggering situation - maybe at work, or during a challenging family dinner - you can quietly activate this visualization. It's like having an invisible emotional hazmat suit, if you will. And yes, I know that's a weird image, but weird works sometimes, doesn't it?

What I love most about this practice is how it combines the power of imagination with our very real need for safety. It's like giving your nervous system a gentle hug while also creating a practical tool for boundary-setting. And let's be honest - many of us with CPTSD didn't exactly get a master class in boundaries growing up.

Take your time exploring this one. Some days it might feel really strong and solid, other days it might be more like a gentle mist - and that's perfectly okay. The key is to make it yours. Play with different colors, textures, or even add some movement to it if that feels right. Remember, we're not going for some perfect visualization here - we're creating a personal tool that works for you in your healing journey.

You know what I'm realizing as we wrap up today? All this visualization stuff we've been talking about - it's kind of like learning to ride a bike. At first, you might feel wobbly and uncertain, maybe even fall a few times, but that's just part of finding your balance. And just like riding a bike, once you get it, it becomes this incredible tool for freedom and exploration.

Here's what I want you to take away from our conversation today: start small. Maybe begin with just thirty seconds of visualizing your safe space while you're brushing your teeth. That's it. No pressure to make it perfect or profound. Just thirty seconds of imagining somewhere that feels good to you. It could be as simple as picturing yourself petting a cat or feeling sunshine on your face.

I've noticed in my own healing journey that the smallest steps often lead to the biggest breakthroughs. And you know what? Sometimes those breakthroughs come when we least expect them - like when we're just hanging out with our visualization practice, not trying to force anything.

Remember how we talked about making this practice your own? That's really what integration is all about. It's taking these tools we've discussed and weaving them naturally into your daily life in a way that feels authentic to you. No need to turn your whole routine upside down - just find those little moments where visualization can slip in naturally.

And hey, if you try this and it feels weird or doesn't quite click at first, that's totally normal. You're not doing it wrong. You're just learning a new language - the language of your own healing. Take it at your own pace, be gentle with yourself, and know that every tiny step counts.

This is Gregory, and you're tuned into ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" You know those moments when you're about to walk into a family gathering, and your entire nervous system goes into overdrive? Yeah, we're diving deep into that today - how to navigate family dynamics when you're dealing with CPTSD.

I've got to tell you, this topic hits close to home for me. Just last week, I was sitting at my kitchen table, staring at a text from my sister about an upcoming family reunion, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. That's when I knew we needed to have this conversation.

Family relationships with CPTSD are like trying to walk through a familiar house where someone's constantly moving the furniture - you think you know where everything is, but you keep bumping into unexpected emotional corners. Whether it's dealing with triggers during holiday dinners, managing boundaries with relatives who don't understand trauma, or processing childhood memories that pop up during family interactions - it's complex stuff, and you're not alone in struggling with it.

In today's episode, we're going to break this down in a way that actually makes sense. I'll share some real stories from our community - because let's face it, sometimes hearing someone else's experience helps us understand our own. We'll explore practical strategies that go beyond the typical ""just set boundaries"" advice (because we all know it's never that simple), and I'll walk you through some research-backed techniques that have helped both me and many of my clients.

You'll learn how to recognize when your trauma response is being activated during family interactions, how to create safety plans for challenging family situations, and most importantly, how to honor your healing journey while navigating these relationships. We'll also talk about something that often gets overlooked - how to handle the grief that comes with changing family dynamics as you heal.

I've got some powerful tools to share with you today, including a grounding technique specifically designed for family situations that I've been refining with my therapy group. And don't worry - I'll break everything down into manageable pieces because I know how overwhelming this topic can be.

So grab your coffee, tea, or whatever comforts you, and let's dive into this together. Remember, you're not broken - you're responding normally to abnormal experiences, and together we're going to make sense of this particular piece of the CPTSD puzzle.

Let's start by exploring what makes family dynamics especially challenging when you're dealing with CPTSD...

So let me share something personal that really gets to the heart of why family dynamics can be such a minefield when you're dealing with CPTSD. Last Thanksgiving, I found myself sitting at my sister's dining room table, gripping my fork way too tightly, feeling that familiar tightness in my chest while my mom was going on about how we ""always had such a happy home."" And I'm sitting there thinking, ""Are we talking about the same house? The same childhood?""

Here's what makes family stuff so uniquely challenging - we're dealing with people who were often there when our trauma happened, but who might have completely different memories or perspectives about it. It's like we're all watching the same movie but seeing totally different plots. And that disconnect? That can make you feel like you're losing your mind.

I remember the first time I tried explaining to my dad how certain childhood experiences had affected me. He looked at me like I was speaking Klingon, and honestly, that reaction hurt more than the original memories. Because here's the thing - when we're working on healing from CPTSD, we're not just dealing with past trauma. We're often trying to navigate current relationships with people who were part of that past, and that's some complicated shit to untangle.

You know what really gets me? The way our bodies react in these family situations. Like, you can be a totally functional adult in every other area of your life, crushing it at work, maintaining healthy friendships, but the moment you walk into a family gathering, suddenly you're emotionally right back in third grade. Your nervous system goes haywire, and you find yourself either wanting to hide under the table or ready to fight anyone who looks at you sideways.

I had this client - let's call her Sarah - who was doing amazing in therapy, making huge strides in her healing journey. Then one phone call from her mother would send her into a tailspin for days. And you know what? That's completely normal. Our family relationships are often ground zero for our trauma, so of course they're going to trigger our strongest reactions.

The tricky part is that these aren't just random people we can choose to avoid (though sometimes that becomes necessary for our wellbeing). These are people we share DNA with, holiday traditions with, and often, deep emotional connections with - despite the trauma. It's like trying to defuse a bomb while simultaneously trying to preserve the building it's in. Complex doesn't even begin to cover it.

I remember when I first started working on my own family dynamics in therapy. My therapist asked me to draw my family tree, and I just sat there, pen hovering over the paper, feeling this overwhelming mix of love, anger, grief, and guilt. Because that's another thing about family dynamics with CPTSD - the emotions are rarely simple. You can love someone deeply and still be hurt by them. You can miss someone terribly and still need strong boundaries with them.

What I've learned, both personally and professionally, is that navigating family dynamics with CPTSD isn't about finding perfect solutions. It's about finding workable ones. It's about understanding that it's okay to love people from a distance, to set boundaries that feel uncomfortable at first, to acknowledge both the good and the harmful in your family history.

Sometimes it means accepting that certain family members might never understand your experience or validate your feelings. And yeah, that sucks. It really does. But understanding this can actually be freeing. It means we can stop trying to make them understand and instead focus on what we can control - our own responses, our own boundaries, our own healing.

The reality is, when we're dealing with CPTSD, family dynamics often feel like walking through an emotional minefield in the dark. But here's what gives me hope, and what I want you to hold onto as we dive deeper into this topic: you don't have to figure this out alone, and you don't have to figure it out all at once. Small steps count. Setting one boundary counts. Taking care of yourself during family gatherings counts. Even just acknowledging that this is hard - that counts too.

In the next part of our conversation, we're going to look at some specific strategies for handling these complex family situations. But first, I want you to know that whatever you're feeling about your family dynamics - whether it's guilt, anger, confusion, or all of the above - it's valid. Your experiences are valid, even if some family members see things differently.

Let me share something that really hit home for me recently. I was talking with a member of our community who said, ""Greg, I feel like I'm speaking a different language than my family."" And holy shit, did that resonate. Because when you're dealing with CPTSD, you kind of are speaking a different language – the language of trauma awareness.

You know those family gatherings where everyone's playing their usual roles? Maybe you're the ""sensitive one"" or the ""troublemaker"" or the ""quiet one."" These labels got slapped on us years ago, and they stick like emotional superglue. But here's what's wild – once you start healing from CPTSD, those roles don't fit anymore. It's like trying to wear your middle school clothes to a job interview. Not gonna work, right?

The tricky part is that our families often have this investment in keeping us in those old roles. It's comfortable for them. When we start setting boundaries or speaking our truth, it rocks the whole family boat. And let me tell you, some family members will do everything they can to steady that boat – even if it means pushing us back into our old, uncomfortable positions.

Now, I want to talk about something that doesn't get discussed enough – the grief that comes with healing. Yeah, you heard that right. As we heal from CPTSD and start navigating family dynamics differently, we often go through this profound grieving process. We're grieving the family we wished we had, the support we never got, and sometimes, we're grieving relationships that need to change or end for our own well-being.

Here's a mind-bender for you: Sometimes the healthiest thing we can do is disappoint our family. Shit, that's a hard pill to swallow, isn't it? But think about it – if your family's expectations are rooted in dysfunction, meeting those expectations means maintaining that dysfunction. It's like being the designated driver in a car that's heading straight for a cliff. At some point, you've got to grab the wheel and change direction, even if everyone else in the car is yelling at you to stay the course.

Let's talk about triggers for a minute. Family gatherings are like trigger festivals, am I right? That's because our families were often there when our trauma patterns were first established. Something as simple as the tone of someone's voice or a certain facial expression can send us right back to that scared kid we used to be. And here's the kicker – most of our family members have no idea this is happening. They're just carrying on like it's any other Tuesday while we're having a full-blown emotional flashback.

But here's where it gets interesting – and I mean interesting in that ""oh shit, this explains so much"" kind of way. Our CPTSD responses in family situations aren't just about the past. They're also about the present moment when old patterns get reinforced. Like when your mom still treats you like you're 12, or your sibling dismisses your feelings just like they did 20 years ago.

I want to share something that happened to me recently. I was at a family dinner, and someone made one of those ""jokes"" that aren't really jokes – you know the ones I mean. In the past, I would have either laughed it off or gotten defensive and started a fight. But this time, I took a breath and said, ""When you say things like that, it hurts. I know you might not mean it that way, but that's how it impacts me."" The silence that followed was deafening, but holy hell, did it feel good to speak my truth calmly.

This brings me to an important point about authenticity in family dynamics. When we're healing from CPTSD, we're essentially learning to be our authentic selves in spaces where that wasn't always safe or welcomed. It's like being an actor who's always played a certain character, and suddenly you want to perform without the mask. It's terrifying, but it's also liberating.

The reality is, some family members will get it, and some won't. Some might even become hostile to the changes they see in you. And that's where we need to get really honest with ourselves about what kind of relationships we can realistically have with different family members. Sometimes that means creating more distance, setting firmer boundaries, or accepting that some relationships might need to be limited to surface-level interactions.

Remember this: You're not responsible for managing your family's emotions about your healing journey. That's not your job. Your job is to take care of yourself and continue growing, even when that growth makes others uncomfortable. It's like putting on your own oxygen mask first – you can't help anyone else if you're not breathing.

And speaking of breathing, let's pause here for a moment. Take a deep breath with me. Because what we're talking about isn't easy. It's complex, it's emotional, and it's deeply personal. But understanding these dynamics is crucial for our healing journey with CPTSD. And in just a bit, we're going to dive into some specific strategies for handling these situations, but first, I want to share some stories from our community members who've been exactly where you are right now.

So let's dig into what the research actually tells us about navigating these complex family dynamics when you're dealing with CPTSD, because honestly, the science here is fascinating and – more importantly – it validates so many of our experiences.

You know how we sometimes question whether we're ""overreacting"" or if it's ""all in our heads""? Well, Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's groundbreaking research, published in ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" shows us that our bodies and brains literally change in response to chronic family trauma. His studies using brain imaging revealed that when people with CPTSD encounter triggering family situations, their amygdala – that ancient alarm system in our brain – actually shows heightened activity while the prefrontal cortex, our rational thinking center, becomes less active.

Here's what blows my mind: A 2019 study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress found that about 68% of people with CPTSD report the most significant triggers come from family interactions. And get this – it's not just about the big, obvious trauma moments. Dr. Martin Teicher's research at Harvard Medical School demonstrates that seemingly ""minor"" but persistent family dynamics, like emotional neglect or invalidation, can actually create more lasting impacts than single traumatic events.

Now, I want to share something that really hit home for me. Dr. Pat Ogden's work on sensorimotor psychotherapy – stick with me here, I know it sounds technical – shows that our bodies hold these family patterns. When we're around certain family members, our nervous system remembers and responds before our conscious mind even processes what's happening. That's why you might feel that knot in your stomach before your mother even opens her mouth, or your shoulders tense up just walking into your childhood home.

The research on boundaries – which we know are crucial but damn difficult to maintain with family – is particularly interesting. A longitudinal study by Dr. Judith Herman showed that survivors who successfully established and maintained boundaries with family members showed significant improvement in their CPTSD symptoms over time. We're talking about a 42% reduction in hypervigilance and a 38% decrease in emotional flashbacks. Those are some serious numbers, folks.

But here's where it gets really interesting – and maybe a bit validating for many of you. A 2020 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation looked at family systems where one member was working on their CPTSD recovery. They found that when the survivor started setting boundaries and changing their role in the family dynamic, about 65% of families initially responded with increased resistance and attempts to pull the person back into old patterns. Sound familiar? Yeah, I thought so.

The good news is that the same study showed that when survivors stuck to their boundaries – even through that initial pushback – about 40% of families eventually adapted and developed healthier interaction patterns. Now, I know that means 60% didn't, and we need to be real about that. Sometimes healing means accepting that not every relationship can or should be saved.

Dr. Stephen Porges's Polyvagal Theory gives us some fascinating insights into why family gatherings can feel so overwhelming. His research shows that our nervous system is constantly scanning for safety, and when we're around people associated with past trauma, our body automatically shifts into a survival state. This isn't weakness or oversensitivity – it's literally our biology trying to protect us.

Let me share something really hopeful though. Recent research from the field of epigenetics suggests that while trauma can change how our genes express themselves, these changes aren't necessarily permanent. Dr. Rachel Yehuda's work shows that as we heal and create new patterns of interaction, we can actually influence our genetic expression. In other words, the healing work you're doing isn't just psychological – it's biological too.

A 2021 study in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that people with CPTSD who developed what they called a ""flexible contact approach"" with family – meaning they learned to adjust their level of interaction based on their current capacity and the family member's behavior – showed better outcomes than those who tried to maintain either full contact or no contact across all situations. It's about finding that sweet spot that works for you, and the research supports this nuanced approach.

You know what else the research validates? That feeling of being emotionally hungover after family interactions. Studies show that people with CPTSD often need 2-3 days to regulate their nervous system after significant family contact. This isn't you being ""too sensitive"" – it's your body processing a legitimate stress response.

I want to wrap up this research section by mentioning Dr. Frank Anderson's work on Internal Family Systems and CPTSD. His studies show that when we understand and work with our different internal parts – you know, that part that wants to please family, that part that wants to run away, that part that gets angry – we're better equipped to handle external family dynamics. It's like having an internal family meeting before dealing with your actual family.

Remember, all this research isn't just academic stuff – it's validation that what you're experiencing is real, measurable, and understood by science. Your responses to family dynamics aren't character flaws; they're normal reactions to abnormal situations. And most importantly, this research shows us that change is possible, even if it's not always easy.

So here's where things get really interesting - and maybe a bit messy, because family dynamics with CPTSD aren't just about understanding what happened to us. It's about navigating what's happening right now, in real-time, when Aunt Karen starts pushing all those buttons you didn't even know you had until you're suddenly hiding in the bathroom at Thanksgiving dinner. Trust me, I've been there, and that bathroom tile becomes really fascinating when you're trying to regulate your nervous system.

Let me share something that took me years to fully grasp - and I mean really get deep in my bones. When we're dealing with family dynamics, we're not just dealing with present-day interactions. We're simultaneously processing past trauma, managing current triggers, and trying to protect our future selves. It's like playing 3D chess while riding a unicycle - backwards. And in heels. Okay, maybe not the heels part, but you get what I mean.

Here's where it gets nuanced - and this is crucial - the hardest part isn't usually the big, obvious conflicts. It's those subtle, almost invisible moments that can completely derail us. Like when your mother uses that specific tone of voice that makes you feel six years old again, or when your sibling gives you that look that used to precede hours of torment. These micro-moments trigger our nervous system before our conscious mind even registers what's happening.

Now, I want to talk about something we don't discuss enough - the guilt. Oh my god, the guilt. You're working on setting boundaries, right? You're doing all the ""right"" things, but then comes that voice in your head saying, ""But they're family."" And suddenly you're questioning everything. Here's the thing - that guilt isn't yours to carry. It was installed by the same system that caused the trauma in the first place. It's like malware in your emotional operating system.

Let's dig even deeper into something that might feel really uncomfortable - the way trauma bonds can masquerade as love. This is particularly thorny because our brains are literally wired to seek connection with our family members, even when those connections hurt us. It's like having an allergic reaction to something your body desperately craves. Understanding this contradiction is crucial because it explains why ""just cutting them off"" isn't always the simple solution some people make it out to be.

And speaking of cutting off - let's talk about the spectrum of contact. I see so many people beating themselves up because they think their only options are full contact or no contact. But there's this whole beautiful middle ground that nobody talks about. You can have parallel contact, where you're in the same room but maintain emotional distance. You can have structured contact, where you only engage under specific circumstances. You can have indirect contact through other family members. The possibilities are as unique as your situation.

Something that's really been blowing my mind lately is how our nervous system can actually get addicted to chaos. If you grew up in an environment where hypervigilance was necessary for survival, peace can feel threatening. This explains why some of us unconsciously stir up drama in otherwise calm family situations - it's not because we're broken or bad, it's because calm feels foreign and therefore dangerous to our survival brain.

Let me share a personal revelation that might resonate with you. I used to think I needed to fix my family relationships to heal myself. Plot twist - it was actually the other way around. As I focused on healing myself, my ability to navigate family dynamics naturally evolved. It's like putting on your own oxygen mask first - you can't help anyone else if you're passing out from lack of air.

This brings me to something really important about healing in the context of family dynamics - it's not linear. You might have an amazing breakthrough, handle a family gathering like a boss, and then get completely sideswiped by something seemingly minor the next day. That's normal. That's part of the process. Your healing doesn't need to look like anyone else's.

Here's a mind-bender that changed everything for me: Sometimes the most loving thing you can do - both for yourself and your family - is to disappoint them. Let that sink in. When you break generational patterns, when you refuse to play your assigned role in the family drama, when you choose your well-being over their comfort - you're actually creating space for everyone to grow, even if they never take advantage of that space.

And you know what? Sometimes growth means grieving the family you wished you had while learning to accept the family you actually have. This doesn't mean giving up or giving in - it means acknowledging reality so you can work with what's actually there instead of exhausting yourself trying to change what isn't.

The really beautiful thing about this work - and yes, I said beautiful, because it is - is that as you navigate these dynamics with more awareness and compassion for yourself, you start to see possibilities you couldn't see before. You start to understand that you can love someone and still not trust them with your heart. You can wish someone well and still not want them in your life. You can honor your family's influence on who you are while choosing to be someone different.

Let's wrap this part up with something that might feel counterintuitive: Sometimes the strongest boundaries look like silence. Sometimes the deepest healing happens in the spaces between words. And sometimes the most profound change in family dynamics starts with simply learning to sit with your own discomfort instead of rushing to fix everything and everyone around you.

You know what really drives this home? The stories I hear from our community. Like Sarah's email from last week – she wrote something that just knocked me sideways, in the best possible way. After twenty years of trying to fix her family's dysfunction, she finally realized she was allowed to just... exist. Not solve, not heal, not manage everyone's emotions. Just be.

""Gregory,"" she wrote, ""I spent my entire Christmas dinner just watching the chaos unfold instead of jumping in to smooth things over. And you know what? The world didn't end. My mom still got triggered, my dad still retreated to his garage, my sister still made passive-aggressive comments about everyone's life choices – but for the first time, I wasn't exhausted afterward. Because I wasn't carrying their shit anymore.""

That right there? That's what we're talking about. And it reminds me of another listener, let's call him Marcus, who shared something similar but with an interesting twist. He'd been practicing what we talked about regarding emotional boundaries, and during a family reunion, his aunt started her usual routine of criticizing his career choices. Instead of defending himself or trying to make her understand, he just smiled and said, ""That's an interesting perspective"" and walked away to get some water.

Here's where it gets good – his cousin came up to him later and said, ""I've never seen anyone handle Aunt Linda like that. You made it look so easy."" And Marcus realized he'd not only protected his own peace but had inadvertently shown someone else it was possible to do the same.

Now, I want to share something from Alex – and this one hit particularly close to home for me. They wrote about implementing what we call the ""loving distance"" approach with their mother. ""I always thought setting boundaries meant having these big dramatic confrontations,"" they wrote. ""But what actually worked was slowly, quietly adjusting how much access I gave her to my emotional life. No big speeches, no ultimatums. Just me, consistently protecting my peace, one small decision at a time.""

And isn't that just the perfect illustration of what we were talking about earlier? These subtle shifts can create massive change. It's like turning a huge ship – you don't yank the wheel, you make small, deliberate adjustments that, over time, completely change your course.

Here's another powerful one from Jamie: ""I realized I had this script in my head that family meant tolerating abuse because 'that's just how they are.' But after working on my CPTSD recovery, I finally understood that 'that's just how they are' is exactly why I need boundaries, not an excuse to abandon them.""

Let me tell you about Rachel's experience, because this one really showcases the ripple effect of healing work. She started setting boundaries with her father's emotional dumping, and at first, it felt like the hardest thing she'd ever done. Her siblings were upset because dad was now turning to them instead. But three months later, something fascinating happened – her younger brother started setting his own boundaries. Then her sister. It was like watching dominoes fall in slow motion, but in a good way.

""The funny thing is,"" Rachel wrote, ""now that we've all started standing up for ourselves, our relationships with dad are actually better. Different, sometimes awkward, but more real. He had to learn new ways to connect with us, and though he struggles, he's trying. That would never have happened if we'd kept playing our old roles.""

And this brings me to Miguel's story, which I think perfectly illustrates the power of what I like to call ""compassionate detachment."" He shared how he used to feel physically ill before every family gathering, knowing he'd be pulled into the same old dynamics. But then he started practicing this beautiful metaphor – he imagined himself as a mountain, watching storms pass by. The drama was still there, but he wasn't in it anymore.

""The wild part,"" he wrote, ""was how my family initially freaked out when I stopped engaging in the usual way. My mom actually said, 'You don't love us anymore.' But I just kept being the mountain, solid and present but not swept away by the storm. A year later, our relationships are different. Not perfect, but real. And I can breathe.""

These stories – they're not just anecdotes. They're proof that change is possible, that healing isn't just some abstract concept we talk about but something real people are achieving every day. And yes, it's messy and imperfect and sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back, but it's happening.

I particularly love what Theresa shared about working with her therapist on family dynamics. She said, ""I finally understood that I don't have to attend every argument I'm invited to. My presence at the drama is optional."" How powerful is that? She went on to describe how she started treating family triggers like weather forecasts – she could prepare for them, bring her emotional umbrella, so to speak, but she didn't have to let them ruin her day.

And you know what all these stories have in common? None of these folks waited for their families to change first. They didn't wait for permission or perfect conditions or some magical moment when everyone would suddenly understand and support their healing journey. They just started where they were, with what they had.

Like Lisa wrote, ""I spent years waiting for my family to be ready for me to heal. Then I realized that was like waiting for someone else to brush my teeth for me. Some things you just have to do for yourself, even if no one else understands why or how.""

These stories, your stories, they remind us that we're not alone in this journey. That somewhere out there, someone else is sitting at their family dinner table, practicing being the mountain, choosing peace over people-pleasing, learning that love doesn't have to hurt to be real.

And speaking of real, practical ways to put these insights into action, let's talk about some specific tools and techniques that our community members have found helpful in navigating these tricky waters...

You know what's really powerful about all of this? When we start putting these insights into actual practice. And I want to share some concrete tools that have been absolute game-changers for folks in our community who are restructuring their family dynamics while honoring their CPTSD healing journey.

Let's start with something I call the ""Peace Pause."" It's exactly what it sounds like – when you feel that familiar tension rising during family interactions, whether it's at the dinner table or during a phone call, you give yourself permission to pause. Not just mentally, but physically. You can literally say ""I need a moment"" and step away to breathe. This isn't running away; it's creating sacred space for your nervous system to recalibrate.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. During that pause, I want you to try something that might feel a bit weird at first. Place your hand on your heart and whisper to yourself, ""I'm still safe. I'm an adult now."" This might sound simple, but it's profound because it helps your nervous system distinguish between past and present threats. Your younger self might be screaming ""danger!"" but your adult self can recognize that you have choices now that you didn't have then.

I remember when Maria, one of our regular listeners, shared how she adapted this technique during a particularly challenging family gathering. She created what she calls ""bathroom sanctuaries"" – brief moments where she'd excuse herself to the restroom, not to escape, but to reset. She'd do a quick body scan, shake out her hands, roll her shoulders, and remind herself of her boundaries. It's like hitting the refresh button on your emotional browser, if you will.

Another practical tool that's been incredibly effective is what I like to call ""The Observer's Perch."" This is about practicing the art of witnessing family dynamics without getting pulled into the old, familiar dance. Imagine you're sitting on a comfortable perch, watching the scene unfold below. You can see the patterns, the triggers, the well-worn grooves of interaction, but you're not obligated to slide into them.

Here's the thing about The Observer's Perch – it gives you this amazing superpower of responding rather than reacting. When Aunt Susan makes that passive-aggressive comment about your life choices, instead of immediately diving into defensive mode or shutting down, you can take a beat. From your perch, you might notice, ""Ah, there's that familiar pattern,"" and choose a different response.

Let me share something that's been particularly helpful for many of our listeners – the ""Boundary Blueprint."" Before entering any family situation, take ten minutes to sketch out your non-negotiables. Not just the big boundaries, but the small ones too. Maybe it's deciding ahead of time that you'll leave after two hours, or that certain topics are off-limits for discussion. The key is to write them down and, this is crucial, to also write down how you'll enforce them compassionately.

You know what's fascinating? When we practice these tools, we often discover that what we thought was confrontation is actually just clear communication. It's like turning on the lights in a dark room – suddenly, everything becomes clearer, less threatening.

One tool that's particularly powerful for managing triggered moments is what I call the ""Time Travel Technique."" When you feel yourself getting activated by family dynamics, pause and ask yourself: ""Which part of me is responding right now? Is this present-day me, or is this little me?"" This simple question can create enough space for your adult self to step in and offer comfort to that younger part while maintaining appropriate boundaries in the present.

And here's something that might surprise you – sometimes the most effective tool is simply giving yourself permission to be imperfect at all of this. I call it ""The Practice of Gentle Mistakes."" You're going to mess up. You're going to fall into old patterns sometimes. And that's not just okay – it's part of the process. Each ""mistake"" is actually valuable data about where you might need more support or practice.

Let's talk about the ""Emotional Weather Report"" – a quick internal check-in system you can use before, during, and after family interactions. Just like checking the weather before you leave the house, this tool helps you prepare and adjust accordingly. How's your emotional temperature? What's your stress precipitation level? Are there any emotional storms brewing? This awareness helps you pack the right emotional gear for whatever you might encounter.

Remember, these tools aren't about achieving perfection in family relationships. They're about creating more space for authenticity and healing while honoring your own journey with CPTSD. Think of them as different instruments in your emotional orchestra – sometimes you need the strong brass of firm boundaries, other times the gentle strings of self-compassion.

And speaking of self-compassion, let's move into some specific strategies for maintaining your emotional wellbeing while putting these tools into practice. Because having tools is one thing, but knowing how to sustain their use over time? That's where the real magic happens...

And you know what's fascinating about this self-compassion piece? It's like having an internal lighthouse that guides us through those murky family waters. I've noticed in my own journey – and I'm betting many of you can relate to this – that we often get caught up in what I call the ""should storm."" Should I have said something different? Should I have stayed longer at that family gathering? Should I be feeling this way?

Let me share something that transformed my approach to family dynamics. I started keeping what I call a ""Reality Check Journal."" Not your typical dear diary stuff, but more like field notes from the frontlines of family interactions. Here's why it's powerful: when we're in the thick of family drama, our trauma responses can make everything feel intensely personal and immediate. This journal helps create that crucial bit of distance we need to see patterns more clearly.

Now, I want to talk about something that doesn't get enough attention – the art of the strategic pause. You know those moments when Aunt Karen starts in with her passive-aggressive comments about your life choices? Instead of immediately reacting (which, let's be honest, is what our nervous system is screaming at us to do), we can practice taking a strategic pause. It's like hitting a mental pause button. Take a breath, feel your feet on the ground, and remember that you're an adult now, not that helpless kid you once were.

Speaking of being an adult, here's a game-changer that one of my clients taught me – she calls it ""Adult Me at the Table."" Whenever she's dealing with family, she imagines her adult self literally sitting at a table with her younger, traumatized parts. This allows her to acknowledge both the pain and triggers of her inner child while responding from a place of adult wisdom. Pretty brilliant, right?

But let's get real for a second – sometimes these tools feel impossible to implement when we're drowning in family chaos. That's when we need what I call our ""Emotional Emergency Kit."" Think of it like those break-glass-in-case-of-emergency boxes, but for your mental health. This might include pre-written text messages for setting boundaries, a list of safe people you can reach out to, or even just a playlist that grounds you in your present reality.

Here's something I've learned the hard way – and I mean the really hard way: It's okay to be a work in progress. The other day, I completely fumbled a boundary conversation with my own family member. But instead of spiraling into shame (okay, maybe I spiraled a little), I used it as data. What triggered me? What could I do differently next time? Every interaction becomes a learning opportunity when we approach it with curiosity instead of judgment.

Let's talk about what I call ""The Permission Slip Practice."" Remember those permission slips we needed for school field trips? Well, we can write ourselves permission slips for family situations. Permission to leave early. Permission to say no. Permission to change our minds. Permission to not have it all figured out yet. It might sound silly, but physically writing these down can be incredibly powerful.

Another tool that's been revolutionary for many in our community is the ""Energy Budget."" Just like we budget money, we need to budget our emotional energy when dealing with family. If you know a family gathering is coming up that's going to cost you 80% of your emotional energy, then you need to plan for recovery time. Maybe that means taking a day off work afterward or scheduling extra therapy sessions.

And here's something that often gets overlooked – celebrating our wins, no matter how small they might seem. Did you maintain a boundary for five minutes before caving? That's progress. Did you notice yourself getting triggered and take three deep breaths? Celebration worthy. Did you simply survive a family dinner without completely losing yourself? Pop the champagne (or sparkling water, whatever floats your boat).

Remember, we're not aiming for perfection here. We're aiming for progress, for growth, for gradually building a new way of being with our families that honors both our healing journey and our humanity. It's like building a muscle – each time we practice these tools, we get a little stronger, a little more confident in our ability to navigate these complex dynamics.

The beauty of all these tools is that they can be adapted to fit your unique situation. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to healing from complex trauma or dealing with family dynamics. It's about finding what resonates with you and making it your own.

You know what I love about this whole journey we've been exploring together? It's that moment when you start to see your power in these family situations. Not power over others - that's not what we're after - but power in your own choices, your own boundaries, and your own healing path.

Listen, I get that it can feel overwhelming when you're in the thick of it. Family gatherings, holiday dinners, those random Tuesday phone calls that somehow send you spiraling - they're all opportunities for growth, but damn if they don't feel like emotional minefields sometimes. And that's okay. That's part of the process.

What matters is that you're here, doing the work, making sense of your shit. Every time you set a boundary, every time you pause before reacting, every time you choose to respond differently than your trauma programming suggests - that's victory, my friends. That's healing in action.

Remember, you don't have to have it all figured out right now. Healing isn't linear, and neither are family relationships. Some days you'll nail it, and others you'll feel like you're right back where you started. But you're not. You're carrying new tools, new understanding, and new strength with you.

Take what serves you from today's conversation, leave what doesn't, and know that you're not alone in this journey. We're all figuring it out together, one step at a time.

You've found your way to another episode where we make sense of this messy, complex journey together. I'm Gregory, and today we're diving deep into something that I know hits home for so many of us - those unwanted memories that seem to have a mind of their own, barging in uninvited and often leaving us feeling powerless.

You know those moments - maybe you're just going about your day, making coffee or folding laundry, when suddenly, bam! A memory crashes through like an unwelcome house guest, bringing with it all those familiar sensations: the racing heart, the tightness in your chest, maybe even that dissociative fog that makes everything feel slightly unreal. If you're nodding along right now, you're absolutely not alone in this.

In today's episode, we're going to unpack this whole experience of coping with unwanted memories in the context of Complex PTSD. We'll explore why our brains hold onto these memories so tenaciously, and more importantly, what we can actually do about it. I'll be sharing some real stories from our community - with permission, of course - because there's something incredibly powerful about knowing others are walking similar paths.

We'll get into some practical, research-backed techniques that go beyond the usual ""just breathe"" advice (though breathing is important, don't get me wrong). I've got some specific tools that have helped both me and many of my clients navigate these challenging waters. And yes, some of them might sound a bit weird at first, but stick with me - sometimes the most effective approaches are the ones that make us raise an eyebrow initially.

By the end of our time together, you'll have a better understanding of why these memories surface the way they do, and more importantly, you'll have some concrete strategies for managing them when they show up. Because while we might not be able to completely erase these memories, we can absolutely change our relationship with them and reduce their power over our daily lives.

You know, before we dive deeper into all of this, I think this is a perfect moment for us to do a quick somatic check-in together. Yeah, I know - some of you are probably rolling your eyes right now, thinking ""Oh god, Gregory's going all woo-woo on us again."" But here's the thing - when we're talking about heavy stuff like unwanted memories, our bodies tend to get pretty activated, and I bet some of you are feeling that right now.

So let's just take a moment, and I mean really take a moment. I'm doing this right along with you, by the way - shifting in my chair, feeling my feet flat on the floor. Notice how your body is positioned right now. No need to change anything, just notice. Maybe you're tensed up without even realizing it. That happens to me all the time, especially around my shoulders - they creep up towards my ears like they're trying to become earrings or something.

Take a breath with me. Not one of those forced, yoga-instructor-style deep breaths - just a normal breath. Notice where you feel it. Maybe in your chest, maybe in your belly. For me right now, I'm feeling it mostly in my upper chest, which usually means I'm a bit anxious. Totally normal when we're discussing this kind of stuff.

Now, here's something I find fascinating - and I mean that in my full trauma-nerd way - notice if there's any part of your body that feels particularly tense or uncomfortable right now. Maybe it showed up while we were talking about memories, or maybe it's been there all day. Either way, just acknowledge it. Like, ""Hey there, tension in my jaw, I see you."" No need to fix it or change it.

And if you're not feeling anything in particular, that's completely valid too. Sometimes we're just not tuned into our bodies, and that's okay. It's actually really common for those of us with CPTSD to feel disconnected from our physical selves. It's part of how we survived.

Let's take one more breath together. This time, imagine your breath is like a gentle wave, just moving through whatever you're experiencing right now. Whether that's tension, numbness, discomfort, or ease - it's all welcome here.

Okay, good. That's our check-in. Nothing fancy, no dramatic transformations required. Just a moment to notice where we're at. Because understanding how our bodies respond to these conversations is just as important as understanding the concepts we're discussing. It's all connected, even when it doesn't feel that way.

You know what fascinates me about unwanted memories? It's how sneaky they can be. One minute you're folding laundry or grabbing coffee, and boom – there's that memory you've been trying not to think about, showing up like an uninvited guest at a dinner party. And I get it, I really do. When I first started dealing with my own stuff, I thought the goal was to just... make them go away. Spoiler alert: that didn't work out so great.

Here's what I've learned, and what I wish someone had told me earlier: these memories aren't actually trying to torture us. I know it feels that way sometimes – trust me, I've been there, hiding under my blankets wondering why my brain keeps serving up these greatest hits of awful. But these memories are actually more like smoke alarms that got stuck in the 'on' position. They're trying to keep us safe, they're just really bad at timing.

Let me share something that happened to me last week. I was at the grocery store, right? And they were playing this specific song – doesn't matter which one, but it was from that period in my life when things were particularly rough. And immediately, my body went into that familiar tension mode. You probably know the one – shoulders up to your ears, stomach doing gymnastics, that whole fun package.

But here's where it gets interesting. Instead of doing my usual ""nope, not dealing with this"" dance (which, by the way, totally valid response – no judgment here), I tried something different. I acknowledged it. Just a simple ""Yeah, I hear you"" to that part of myself that was freaking out. And you know what? It didn't make the memory disappear, but it changed something in how I was experiencing it.

Think of it like this: when you're watching a scary movie, it's way less terrifying if you turn the lights on and remember you're just watching a screen. Our unwanted memories are kind of similar. When we can create just a little bit of space between us and the memory – even just enough to say ""Oh, this is happening right now"" – it changes the whole dynamic.

Now, I'm not suggesting we all become best friends with our trauma memories. That's not the point at all. But there's this middle ground between being completely overwhelmed by them and trying to stuff them in a box labeled ""never open."" It's more like... learning to coexist with them while building a life that's about more than just surviving them.

And you know what's wild? The more we practice this – this gentle acknowledgment without getting pulled into the undertow – the more our nervous system starts to get the memo. It's like teaching an old dog new tricks, except the dog is our brain's threat-detection system, and the new trick is ""maybe everything isn't an emergency.""

Look, I know this isn't easy stuff. If you're sitting there thinking ""Greg, you make it sound so simple,"" I hear you. It's not simple at all. It's messy and complicated and sometimes feels impossible. But that's exactly why we're here, working through this together. Because while we can't change what happened to us, we can change how we relate to those memories. And sometimes, that makes all the difference in the world.

Remember, this isn't about perfection – it's about progress. And progress in this context might just look like being a little kinder to ourselves when these memories show up uninvited. Because at the end of the day, that's really what healing is about: learning to be on our own side, even when – especially when – things get messy.

So here's what I want to try together – a really gentle practice that we can use when those unwanted memories start creeping in. I know some of you might be driving or doing dishes right now, and that's totally cool. Just take in what resonates and maybe come back to this practice when you're in a space where you can really sink into it.

Let's start where we are. Notice whatever position you're in right now – whether you're sitting, standing, lying down. And I want you to imagine that your body is like one of those snow globes. You know the ones – where all the glitter and sparkly bits are swirling around like crazy after someone gives it a shake. That's kind of what it feels like when memories ambush us, right? Everything gets stirred up.

Now, just like with a snow globe, we're not going to try to force anything to settle faster. We're just going to create some space for whatever's happening. Take a breath that feels comfortable – nothing fancy, just your normal breath. And as you breathe, imagine you're watching your snow globe self with curiosity rather than judgment. No need to change anything.

Here's where it gets interesting – and I mean that in the gentlest way possible. When you notice a memory floating by, try giving it a little nod of acknowledgment. Like, ""Hey there, yeah, I see you."" Maybe even put a hand wherever you feel that memory in your body – could be your chest, your belly, your shoulders. Wherever it lives.

And this is the part that usually makes people laugh in my workshops, but I swear it helps – give that sensation a silly name. I'm talking full-on ridiculous. Like ""Bob the uncomfortable butterfly"" or ""Susan the squeezy feeling."" It sounds goofy as hell, but there's something about naming it that helps create just a tiny bit of space between you and the intensity of the memory.

Stay here for just a few more breaths. Notice how the snow globe naturally starts to settle when we don't fight it. Some particles might still be swirling – that's completely okay. We're not aiming for perfect stillness here. We're just practicing being with whatever shows up, even if it's messy.

And whenever you're ready, bring your attention back to the room around you. Maybe wiggle your fingers and toes a bit, take a stretch if that feels good. Remember, this isn't about making memories go away – it's about building a different relationship with them. One where we're not at war with our own experiences.

You can come back to this practice anytime. It doesn't have to be a big formal thing – even just taking thirty seconds to acknowledge what's happening and giving it a ridiculous name can help shift things just enough to keep going with your day.

So here's another practice I really love sharing, and it's one that's helped a lot of my clients when those unwanted memories start playing their greatest hits album in our heads. I call it the ""Time Travel Teammate"" technique, and before you roll your eyes – yeah, I know it sounds a bit woo-woo, but stick with me here.

You know those moments when a memory hits and suddenly you're right back there, feeling like that scared or helpless younger version of yourself? Instead of fighting it, we're going to do something that might feel a little strange at first. We're going to have a conversation with that younger you, but from your present-day perspective.

Here's what's wild about this – your adult self has resources, understanding, and strength that your younger self didn't have access to. When I first tried this, I felt kind of ridiculous, but then something clicked. I realized that younger me was carrying this massive burden all alone, thinking he had to figure everything out by himself. Sound familiar?

The practice is pretty straightforward. When a memory surfaces, take a moment to visualize your current self sitting with your younger self in that memory. What would you say to them? What kind of support did you need back then that you can offer now? Maybe it's as simple as ""Hey, this isn't your fault"" or ""I've got you, and we're going to get through this.""

What's fascinating is how this practice can help shift the memory from being this overwhelming force to something more manageable. It's like having a wise, compassionate ally in your corner – and plot twist, that ally is you.

I had a client who used to get completely derailed by memories of being criticized in front of her class in third grade. Using this practice, she started visualizing her adult self walking into that classroom, sitting next to little-her, and just being there as a supportive presence. She told me it changed the whole feeling of the memory – it wasn't about being alone anymore.

The beauty of this practice is that it helps integrate these different parts of ourselves. We're not trying to erase the past or pretend it didn't happen. Instead, we're building a bridge between then and now, creating a kind of internal support system that can help us navigate these challenging moments.

Remember, this isn't about fixing or changing the past – it's about bringing compassion and understanding to those parts of ourselves that are still carrying those experiences. And sometimes, that's exactly what we need to move forward.

You know what's really beautiful about all of this work we're doing? It's not about reaching some magical endpoint where we never have another unwanted memory pop up. Hell, I still get them too. But now, instead of feeling like I'm drowning every time, I've got this... let's call it a trauma-savvy toolbox that helps me ride those waves.

Here's what I want you to take away from our conversation today: You're not broken. Your brain and body are doing exactly what they were designed to do - trying to keep you safe. Sometimes they're working a bit too hard at it, sure, but that's not your fault. And more importantly, you've got options. Whether it's the grounding techniques we talked about, creating those safe spaces in your mind, or reaching out to your support system - you get to choose what works for you.

Start small. Maybe tomorrow morning, when you're brushing your teeth, try one of those brief body scans we practiced. That's it. Just one tiny step. Because healing from trauma isn't about making giant leaps - it's about those small, consistent moments where we choose to show up for ourselves.

And listen, if today's conversation brought up stuff that feels too heavy to carry alone, remember those resources we discussed. There's no shame in reaching out. Actually, it's pretty damn brave.

I'm going to be right here, continuing this journey with you. Next time, we'll be diving into somatic therapy, which fits perfectly with what we've explored today. Until then, be gentle with yourself. You're doing the best you can with what you've got, and that's more than enough.

This is Gregory, and you're tuning in to ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" I'm so glad you're here with me today because we're diving into something that has honestly changed my life and the lives of many others - somatic therapy for trauma recovery.

You know, for years, I thought healing was all about talking, processing memories, and changing thought patterns. Don't get me wrong, those are important pieces of the puzzle. But what I discovered - and what we're exploring today - is how profoundly our bodies hold onto trauma, and how working with our physical experiences can unlock healing in ways that words alone sometimes can't touch.

I'm especially excited about today's episode because somatic therapy often feels like this mysterious, intimidating thing that people hear about but aren't quite sure what to make of. Trust me, I get it. When I first heard terms like ""body-based interventions"" and ""somatic experiencing,"" I was skeptical. But stick with me, because we're going to break this down in a way that actually makes sense.

Throughout this episode, we'll explore what somatic therapy really is - none of that fancy clinical jargon, just practical understanding of how our bodies process trauma and how we can work with that. I'll share some powerful stories from listeners who've experienced somatic therapy firsthand, including some pretty amazing breakthrough moments that honestly gave me goosebumps.

We'll also dig into the science behind why this approach works, and I'll guide you through some gentle somatic techniques you can try right now, wherever you are. Don't worry - we're talking simple, accessible tools that don't require any special equipment or expertise. Just you, connecting with your body in ways that feel safe and manageable.

By the end of our time together, you'll have a solid grasp of how somatic therapy might fit into your healing journey, along with some concrete resources and next steps if you want to explore this path further. And for those of you who might be feeling a bit nervous about body-based work - I hear you. We'll talk about how to approach this at your own pace, with plenty of respect for your boundaries and comfort level.

So get comfortable, maybe grab something warm to drink, and let's explore this together. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and every step you take toward understanding your trauma and healing is valuable, no matter how small it might seem.

You know, I remember the first time I heard about somatic therapy. I was sitting in my therapist's office, feeling completely disconnected from my body – like I was just a floating head carrying around this meat suit that I didn't really understand or trust. And she said something that stopped me in my tracks: ""Gregory, trauma isn't just stored in your memories. It lives in your body too.""

That hit me like a ton of bricks, friends. Here I was, thinking I could just think my way out of trauma, using all these cognitive techniques and rational approaches. Don't get me wrong – those are valuable tools, but I was missing this whole other dimension of healing. My body was literally keeping score of every single thing that had happened to me, and I hadn't been listening to it at all.

So let me paint you a picture of what that looked like for me. I'd be going about my day, feeling relatively okay, when suddenly my shoulders would be up around my ears, my jaw would be clenched tight enough to crack nuts, and my stomach would be doing somersaults. And my brain would be like, ""What's the problem? Everything's fine!"" But my body – oh, my body knew something wasn't right.

That's where somatic therapy comes in, and it's why I'm so excited to dive deep into this topic with you today. It's this incredible approach that helps us tune into these physical sensations and actually work with them instead of trying to think our way around them. And let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for so many people in our community.

Now, I know what some of you might be thinking – ""Gregory, this sounds kind of woo-woo."" Trust me, I had the same thought at first. I was skeptical as hell. But here's the thing about somatic therapy: it's actually based on solid neuroscience. It's about understanding how trauma gets stored in our nervous system and learning how to release it safely.

Think about it like this: have you ever seen a wild animal after a near-death experience? They literally shake it off. That's not just some random thing – it's their nervous system naturally releasing that trauma response. But us humans? We've gotten really good at suppressing these natural responses. We hold onto that tension, that trauma, and it gets stuck in our bodies like old software that keeps running in the background.

I remember this one time, during a somatic therapy session, when my therapist asked me to just notice where I felt tension in my body. Simple enough, right? But when I actually tuned in, I realized I had been holding my breath for who knows how long. Just that simple awareness led to this profound release, and suddenly I was crying – not from sadness, but from this deep sense of relief I didn't even know I needed.

That's what makes somatic therapy so powerful for those of us dealing with CPTSD. It gives us a way to access and process trauma that might be completely outside our conscious awareness. It's like having a conversation with parts of ourselves that don't speak in words, but in sensations, movements, and feelings.

And here's what I really love about it – it meets you exactly where you are. You don't have to be super in touch with your body to start. Hell, you might feel completely disconnected from your body right now, and that's totally okay. The beauty of somatic work is that it's gentle, it's patient, and it moves at your pace.

I've got to be honest with you – this work can be challenging. There might be times when it feels overwhelming or scary to tune into your body's sensations. That's completely normal, and it's actually part of the process. But the key thing to remember is that you're not diving into the deep end alone. Somatic therapy gives you tools to stay grounded, to maintain that sense of safety, and to gradually build a new relationship with your body.

What really blows my mind is how this approach can help with symptoms that might seem totally unrelated to trauma. I'm talking about things like chronic pain, digestive issues, sleep problems – all these physical manifestations that we might have written off as ""just the way things are."" When we start to understand the connection between our trauma and our physical experiences, it opens up whole new possibilities for healing.

So as we dive deeper into this topic today, I want you to keep something in mind: your body isn't your enemy. It's not broken, and it hasn't betrayed you. It's been doing its absolute best to keep you safe, even if some of those protective mechanisms aren't serving you anymore. And the good news is, with the right support and tools, you can start to rebuild that connection and trust with your body.

You know what's fascinating about somatic therapy? It's like having a conversation with parts of yourself that have been trying to get your attention for years, but speaking a language you couldn't quite understand. Let me tell you about my first experience with somatic work - I remember sitting there, skeptical as hell, while my therapist asked me to just... notice what my body was doing. And I'm thinking, ""Well, it's sitting here, what else would it be doing?""

But here's where it gets interesting. When we start paying attention - really paying attention - we notice these subtle signals our body's been sending all along. Maybe your shoulders creep up toward your ears during certain conversations, or your stomach does this weird flip thing when you walk into spaces that remind you of difficult times. These aren't random glitches - they're actually really important messages.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Greg, I don't want to feel what's in my body. That's literally why I've spent years perfecting the art of checking out."" And I get it, I really do. When you've experienced trauma, especially complex trauma, your body can feel like a minefield of uncomfortable sensations and memories. But here's the thing - we're not diving into the deep end right away. Somatic therapy is more like dipping your toes in the shallow end, with someone right there beside you who knows how to keep you safe.

Let me paint a picture of what this actually looks like in practice. You might start with something as simple as noticing where you feel most stable in your body. Maybe it's your feet planted firmly on the ground, or the support of the chair against your back. We're not trying to fix anything or change anything - we're just building awareness, creating a kind of home base that you can return to when things get overwhelming.

The real magic happens when we start to understand that these physical sensations - the tightness in your chest, the knot in your stomach, the tension headaches - they're not just random symptoms to be eliminated. They're actually part of your story, carrying important information about your experiences and what you need to feel safe.

I remember working with a client - let's call her Sarah - who always felt this intense pressure in her throat whenever she needed to set boundaries. Through somatic work, she discovered that this sensation was connected to all the times she had to stay quiet as a child to keep the peace in her household. Her body was literally holding onto that experience of having to swallow her words. And you know what? Once she could understand and work with that sensation, rather than fighting against it, she started finding her voice in ways she never thought possible.

Here's something that blew my mind when I first learned it: trauma isn't just stored in our memories - it's stored in our tissue, in our nervous system, in the very way we hold ourselves. That's why sometimes just talking about our experiences isn't enough. We need to include our bodies in the healing process.

And let's be real - this shit can feel weird at first. There might be moments when you're sitting there, focusing on a sensation in your body, and you think, ""This is the stupidest thing I've ever done."" I had plenty of those moments myself. But then something shifts - maybe you notice that the crushing anxiety you always carry starts to ease a bit, or you finally understand why certain situations send you into freeze mode.

The beauty of somatic therapy is that it gives us practical tools to work with these experiences. It's not about reliving trauma or forcing yourself to feel everything at once. It's about building a relationship with your body where you can listen to its signals without being overwhelmed by them.

Think of it like learning a new language - at first, everything sounds like noise. But gradually, you start to recognize patterns, understand meanings, and eventually, you can engage in actual dialogue. That's what we're doing with somatic work - learning to understand and respond to our body's language.

And you know what's really cool? This work can happen anywhere. Sure, it's great to have a trained therapist guiding you, but you can start building body awareness right now, wherever you are. Maybe you notice how your breathing changes when you're stressed, or how certain movements help you feel more grounded. These small observations are the building blocks of deeper somatic work.

I want to emphasize something really important here - there's no rush. Your body has been holding onto these patterns for years, maybe decades. It's okay to take your time, to move at a pace that feels safe for you. This isn't about forcing breakthrough moments or dramatic transformations. It's about gradually rebuilding trust with the very vessel that carries you through life.

As we continue exploring this topic, we're going to look at some specific techniques and approaches that can help you start this journey of reconnection. But for now, I want you to just sit with this idea: your body's responses, even the ones that feel uncomfortable or frightening, are not your enemy. They're part of a complex system that's been working overtime to keep you safe. And with patience, compassion, and the right support, you can start to work with this system rather than against it.

So let's dig into what science has to say about all this, because I know some of you are probably thinking ""Greg, this sounds nice and all, but where's the proof?"" And honestly? That's a fantastic question - one I asked myself when I first encountered somatic therapy.

Here's what's fascinating: researchers at the University of California found that trauma literally gets stored in our body tissues. They discovered that when we experience trauma, it's not just our brain that holds onto it - our muscles, fascia, and even our nervous system keep a record. This explains why you might feel that knot in your stomach when you're triggered, or why your shoulders instantly tense up in certain situations.

A groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress showed that people who participated in body-based trauma therapies experienced a 40% greater reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to traditional talk therapy alone. And you know what's wild? The improvements stuck around even during follow-up assessments a year later.

Now, I'm going to share something that blew my mind when I first learned about it. Dr. Stephen Porges - and if you haven't heard of his Polyvagal Theory, buckle up - demonstrated how our nervous system has this incredible built-in capacity for healing. His research showed that our bodies are constantly scanning for safety or danger through something called neuroception. It's like having a security system that's running 24/7, except sometimes, with trauma, the alarm gets stuck in the ""on"" position.

But here's where it gets really interesting - and I wish someone had told me this years ago when I was struggling to understand why I couldn't just ""think"" my way out of trauma responses. The research shows that we can't actually access the part of our brain responsible for healing trauma through cognitive processes alone. That's because trauma gets stored in the limbic system and brainstem - parts of our brain that don't respond to language or logical thinking.

You know those moments when your therapist is telling you ""you're safe now"" and your brain is like ""yeah, I know that"" but your body is still in full panic mode? There's actually a neurobiological reason for that! Studies using brain imaging have shown that when we're triggered, blood flow actually decreases in our prefrontal cortex - the thinking part of our brain - and increases in our emotional and survival centers.

But wait, it gets better. Research from the HeartMath Institute has shown that when we engage in somatic practices - like the gentle movements and body awareness exercises we talked about earlier - we can literally change our heart rate variability patterns. This isn't just some woo-woo stuff; it's measurable, physiological change.

And you know what really validates what many of us have felt intuitively? A 2019 meta-analysis - that's a fancy way of saying they looked at lots of different studies together - found that somatic interventions were particularly effective for people with complex trauma. They found that these approaches helped people not just manage their symptoms, but actually process and integrate their traumatic experiences in a way that talk therapy alone often couldn't achieve.

Listen, I remember sitting in my first somatic therapy session, feeling skeptical as hell when the therapist asked me to notice what was happening in my body. But the science backs up why this approach works: when we combine awareness of our body sensations with gentle, supportive processing, we're actually working with our brain's natural healing mechanisms rather than against them.

There's this fascinating study that looked at survivors of childhood trauma who participated in body-based therapeutic approaches. After just 20 weeks, they showed significant improvements not only in their psychological symptoms but also in their immune system function. Their bodies literally became healthier as they processed their trauma through somatic work.

Now, I want to acknowledge something here - because I can almost hear some of you thinking it: ""But Greg, my trauma happened so long ago. Is it too late?"" The research actually has good news on this front too. Studies in neuroplasticity - our brain's ability to create new neural pathways - show that we can develop new, healthier patterns at any age. One study with trauma survivors in their 60s and 70s showed remarkable improvements through somatic work, proving it's never too late to start healing.

And here's something that really validates what many of us have experienced: research has shown that trauma responses aren't ""all in your head"" - they're real, measurable changes in your body's physiology. When you feel that freeze response, or that overwhelming surge of anxiety, your body is actually going through measurable changes in heart rate, muscle tension, and hormone levels.

The evidence is pretty clear: when we work with our bodies rather than trying to override them, we tap into our natural capacity for healing. It's like having a built-in restoration system that's just waiting for the right conditions to activate. And while everyone's journey is different - because let's face it, trauma isn't one-size-fits-all - the research consistently shows that incorporating somatic approaches can significantly enhance our healing process.

And you know what? This isn't just academic theory - these findings align perfectly with what many of us have experienced in our own healing journeys. They explain why sometimes we need to move to feel better, why grounding techniques actually work, and why paying attention to our body's signals isn't just helpful - it's essential for deep, lasting healing.

So here's something fascinating that I've learned through both my own healing journey and working with countless trauma survivors - somatic therapy isn't just about feeling sensations in your body. It's about creating this incredible dialogue between your mind and body that many of us lost access to years ago. And let me tell you, when that connection starts coming back online, holy shit does it change things.

You know those moments when you're sitting with a therapist, trying to explain how you feel, but the words just aren't quite cutting it? That's because trauma isn't stored in the language center of our brains - it's locked in our nervous system, in our muscles, in the very way we hold ourselves. I remember the first time a somatic therapist asked me to just notice where I felt anxiety in my body instead of trying to explain it. It was like someone had handed me a key I didn't even know I needed.

Now, here's where it gets really interesting. When we start working with the body in therapy, we often discover these patterns we had no idea were there. Like, you might suddenly realize you've been holding your shoulders up around your ears for basically your entire adult life. Or that you habitually hold your breath when someone asks you a question. These aren't random habits - they're protective patterns your body created to keep you safe during trauma.

And you know what? Those patterns served a purpose. They really did. But now they're like that security system you installed during a crime wave in the neighborhood - it's still blaring even though the danger has long passed. Through somatic work, we're not trying to tear down these defenses. Instead, we're gently letting our bodies know it's okay to create new patterns.

Let me share something that happened in my own practice recently. I was working with this client - we'll call her Sarah - who had this profound moment during a session. She'd always described this feeling of heaviness in her chest, like she was wearing a lead vest. As we worked somatically, she suddenly made this connection between that sensation and how she'd learned to ""make herself small"" as a kid to avoid her father's rage. That awareness didn't come from talking about it - it came from being present with that sensation in her body.

The really beautiful thing about somatic work is that it meets you exactly where you are. There's no forcing, no pushing through resistance. If you're someone who dissociates easily - and trust me, I get it - you start with just noticing your feet on the floor. That's it. You're not diving into the deep end of trauma work on day one. You're building a relationship with your body at a pace that feels safe.

And speaking of safety - this is crucial - somatic therapy teaches us that safety isn't just an idea in our heads. It's a felt experience in our bodies. When we're truly safe, our nervous system knows it. Our muscles know it. Our breath knows it. But for many of us with CPTSD, that sense of safety got scrambled early on. We're walking around in a constant state of low-grade fight, flight, or freeze, and we don't even realize it because it feels normal to us.

Here's where the magic happens though. As we learn to track these sensations in our bodies, as we practice pendulating between activation and settling, something profound starts to shift. We begin to recognize what genuine safety feels like in our bodies. And once we can recognize it, we can start to cultivate it.

I want to be real with you though - this isn't always comfortable work. Sometimes when we start tuning into our bodies, we encounter sensations or emotions that feel overwhelming. That's completely normal. It's why having a skilled somatic therapist who understands trauma is so important. They can help you develop what we call 'resource states' - positive sensations and experiences you can return to when things feel too intense.

You know, I often think about how many of us with CPTSD learned early on to live from the neck up. We became brilliant thinkers, excellent problem solvers, because it wasn't safe to feel. And while those skills helped us survive - and they did, they absolutely did - healing requires us to gently, carefully rebuild that connection with our bodies.

The thing that continues to amaze me about somatic work is how it can bypass all our well-worn mental pathways. You can understand your trauma intellectually, you can talk about it for years in therapy, but until your body gets the message that the danger has passed, Published healing remains elusive. It's like trying to convince yourself you're not hungry when your stomach is growling - the body has its own wisdom, its own truth.

And that's really what somatic therapy is about - learning to listen to and trust that wisdom again. It's about reclaiming not just our stories, but our entire experience of being alive in these bodies that have carried us through so much. It's about moving from survival to genuine, embodied living.

Let me tell you, when I see someone start to make these connections, when they begin to feel safe in their body maybe for the first time in their life - that's the real deal. That's healing happening right before my eyes. And while it's not always easy, it's some of the most profound work we can do in our recovery journey.

You know what really gets me excited? When I hear from you all about your actual experiences with somatic therapy. Let me share some of the incredible stories that have landed in my inbox lately, because I think they'll really resonate with where many of you might be on your journey right now.

Just last week, I heard from Sarah - and fuck, her story hit me right in the feels. She wrote about how for years, she'd been trying traditional talk therapy, but kept feeling stuck in this loop of understanding her trauma intellectually while still feeling completely disconnected from her body. The first few sessions of somatic therapy were weird as hell for her - her exact words were ""Greg, I felt like a complete idiot just sitting there trying to 'feel my feet.'"" And honestly, I get it. We've all been there, right?

But here's where it gets interesting - about six sessions in, something shifted. Sarah was working through a memory of childhood emotional neglect, and suddenly she noticed this intense tightening in her shoulders. Instead of just talking about it, her therapist guided her to really stay with that sensation. As she did, tears started flowing, and she felt this release she'd never experienced before. She told me it was like her body had been holding onto this message for decades, and it finally had permission to let go.

Then there's Marcus - holy shit, talk about a journey. This guy spent twenty years in the corporate world, completely divorced from his body's signals. He reached out after listening to our episode on freeze responses, and his story about starting somatic therapy really stuck with me. He described his first session as ""like trying to learn a foreign language while blindfolded."" But you know what? He stuck with it.

The breakthrough came during a session where his therapist noticed he would completely stop breathing whenever they discussed his relationship with his father. Just completely freeze up. Through gentle movement work and breathing exercises, Marcus started reconnecting with these stored trauma responses he didn't even know he had. He wrote, ""It was like my body had been screaming at me for years, but I'd had the volume turned all the way down.""

Oh, and this next one - this one really shows how somatic work can surprise the hell out of you. Jamie wrote to me about their experience with chronic pain that no doctor could explain. They'd been to every specialist under the sun, had all the tests, tried all the medications. Started somatic therapy as a last resort, honestly thinking it was probably some new age bullshit (their words, not mine, but I appreciate the honesty!).

During one session, their therapist guided them through a simple movement exercise, and suddenly Jamie found themselves sobbing uncontrollably. Turned out, they were holding decades of anger and grief in their lower back - stuff from growing up in an environment where emotions weren't allowed. As they continued the work, the chronic pain began to shift. Not disappear magically overnight - this isn't some miracle cure infomercial - but change in a way that finally made sense.

But look, it's not all breakthrough moments and dramatic releases. Lisa's story really highlights the day-to-day reality of this work. She wrote about how frustrated she felt at first because it seemed like nothing was happening. She'd sit there trying to ""track sensations"" in her body and just feel awkward and self-conscious. But she kept showing up, kept practicing the little things - like just noticing when she was holding her breath, or when her jaw was clenched.

After about three months, she realized something profound. She was actually starting to feel safe in her own skin. Not all the time, not in every situation, but moments would come where she'd suddenly notice she felt grounded, present, actually in her body instead of floating somewhere above it. She described it as ""coming home to myself, one tiny step at a time.""

And then there's Alex's story, which I think will resonate with a lot of you who are dealing with dissociation. Alex spent years feeling like they were watching their life through a foggy window. Started somatic therapy after a particularly rough period of depression, and the early sessions were challenging as hell because they could barely feel anything in their body at all. Their therapist started super simple - just feeling the pressure of their feet on the floor, the texture of their clothes against their skin.

What I love about Alex's story is how they described the slow wake-up of their body awareness. They wrote, ""It was like my body had been an abandoned house, and I was slowly turning the lights back on, one room at a time. Some rooms were scary as fuck, full of stuff I didn't want to look at. But having my therapist there made it feel possible to peek inside, just a little bit at a time.""

You know what all these stories have in common? They're messy, they're real, and they're not linear. Some days you're having profound breakthroughs, other days you're wondering if you're just wasting your time and money. But that's the reality of healing work, isn't it? It's not about reaching some perfect end state - it's about gradually rebuilding that connection with ourselves that trauma stole from us.

And here's something else these stories remind me of - everyone's somatic journey looks different. What works for Sarah might not work for Marcus. What feels healing for Jamie might feel overwhelming for Lisa. That's why it's so crucial to work with a therapist who gets this, who can meet you where you are and help you find your own path back to embodiment.

These stories, they're not just about individual healing - they're about reclaiming something fundamental that trauma takes from us: our right to feel at home in our own bodies. And whether you're just starting to consider somatic therapy, or you're deep in the work already, I want you to know that wherever you are in this journey is exactly where you need to be right now.

So let's dig into some practical tools you can start working with right now, because I know many of you are thinking, ""Okay Greg, I get it - my body holds trauma. But what the hell do I actually DO about it?"" And that's exactly where we need to go next.

You know how sometimes you're just sitting there, maybe scrolling through your phone, and suddenly you realize your shoulders are practically touching your ears? That's the kind of body awareness we're going to start building on. But here's the thing - we're going to do it gently, because forcing yourself to relax is about as effective as telling yourself to ""calm down"" when you're anxious. Spoiler alert: it usually makes things worse.

Let me share something that changed everything for me. I call it the ""Hello Body"" practice, and it's ridiculously simple - which is exactly why it works. Instead of trying to fix or change anything, you're just saying hello to different parts of your body. Like, ""Hey feet, how're you doing down there?"" It might sound silly - and yeah, it kind of is - but that's actually part of why it works. It breaks down that intense, serious energy we often bring to healing work.

Now, here's where it gets interesting. When you first start doing this, you might notice that certain parts of your body feel... well, kind of absent. Like they're not even there. Or maybe they feel like they belong to someone else. That's completely normal for trauma survivors. We're not trying to change that right away - we're just noticing it. That noticing? That's already healing work.

Let me tell you about what happened with one of my clients - we'll call her Sarah. She couldn't feel her legs at all when we started working together. It was like everything below her waist was just... offline. So we started with just thirty seconds a day of her putting her hands on her thighs and saying ""hello."" That's it. No pressure to feel anything specific, no goal to achieve. Just hello. Three months later, she called me in tears because she felt her feet on the ground for the first time in years.

Here's another tool that's been a game-changer for many folks in our community. I call it the ""Weather Report."" Instead of trying to change how you feel in your body, you just describe it like you're giving a weather report. ""There's a lot of tension in the shoulder region, with some scattered numbness moving into the arms. Heavy pressure system in the chest area..."" It sounds kind of ridiculous, but it does something amazing - it creates just enough distance to make intense bodily sensations more manageable.

And listen, I know some of you are thinking, ""Greg, I can't do this. It's too scary to feel what's in my body."" I hear you. I really do. That's why we start with what I call ""toe-dipping"" - literally. You can start by just feeling your big toe for five seconds. That's it. Five seconds. You're in control. You decide when to start and when to stop. Because here's what's crucial to understand: building a relationship with your body after trauma is like rebuilding trust in any relationship - it happens in tiny moments, one small safe experience at a time.

Something else that's been incredibly helpful for many of us is what I call ""movement snacks"" - tiny bits of movement scattered throughout your day. We're not talking about exercise here. We're talking about stretching your arms up for three seconds, or rolling your shoulders once, or wiggling your toes while you're stuck in traffic. These micro-movements help remind your nervous system that movement can be safe and that you're in charge of your body now.

Here's why this matters so much: trauma often creates what I call ""frozen spots"" in our body - places where we're holding tension we might not even be aware of. These little movement snacks help us start mapping where those spots are, but in a way that doesn't overwhelm our system. It's like turning up the lights in a dark room very, very slowly, rather than flipping them all on at once.

Let me be really clear about something though - and this is important: if any of these tools feel too much right now, that's okay. More than okay, actually. That's your system giving you important information. Sometimes the most healing thing we can do is honor when we're not ready for something. That's not failure - that's wisdom.

Remember what we talked about earlier - this isn't about forcing anything. It's about creating possibilities for connection with your body, one tiny moment at a time. Think of it like tending to a garden. You don't yell at seeds to grow faster, right? You create the conditions that make growth possible, and then you wait, watching for small signs of life.

In the next part of our discussion, we're going to build on these foundational tools and explore some slightly more advanced practices. But for now, I want you to just experiment with these basics. Notice what feels possible and what doesn't. Notice what makes you curious and what makes you want to run for the hills. All of that information is valuable. All of it is part of your healing journey.

Now, let's dig even deeper into the practical side of somatic work, because I know some of you are sitting there thinking, ""Okay Greg, I get it - body awareness matters. But what the hell do I actually DO with all of this?""

Here's something that's been incredibly powerful in my own journey - what I like to call the ""micro-moment check-in."" You know those times when you're triggered, and everything feels like it's moving at warp speed? That's exactly when we need to slow things down. Like, way down. I'm talking Matrix-level bullet-time slow motion here.

Let me paint you a picture. Say you're in a meeting, and someone makes a dismissive comment that hits that old familiar wound. Instead of immediately jumping into the usual stress response - which, let's be real, we've all mastered by now - you take three seconds. Just three. You notice where that trigger lands in your body. Maybe it's that knot in your stomach, or that tightness in your throat. Whatever it is, you're just witnessing it, like ""Huh, there you are, old friend.""

The beauty of this approach is that it starts breaking down that overwhelming tsunami of sensation into manageable pieces. And here's what's wild - when we do this consistently, we actually start rewiring those neural pathways. It's like creating little speed bumps in our trauma response highway.

Something else that's been a game-changer for many of my clients is what I call ""pendulation with training wheels."" Traditional pendulation in somatic experiencing can feel pretty intense when you're starting out. So we're going to modify it a bit. Instead of diving straight into the heavy stuff, we're going to practice with something mildly annoying first. Like, say, being stuck in traffic.

Next time you're sitting there, watching that red light mock you, try this: Notice the frustration building - maybe it's in your shoulders, your jaw, wherever. Then, intentionally shift your attention to something in your environment that feels neutral or pleasant. Maybe it's the way sunlight hits your dashboard, or the feeling of the air conditioning on your skin. Go back and forth between these sensations a few times. It's like building your somatic muscles with baby weights before trying to deadlift your trauma.

Here's something else that's crucial - and I cannot stress this enough - we need to get comfortable with discharge. You know those weird impulses you get when you're processing something intense? The sudden need to shake, or yawn, or make some random sound? That's your nervous system trying to release stored energy. And so many of us have learned to suppress these natural responses because, well, society isn't exactly cool with random shaking in the middle of Starbucks.

But here's the thing - finding safe spaces to allow these releases is absolutely vital. Maybe it's in your car, or your bedroom, or during a therapy session. Whatever works for you. And if you're thinking, ""Greg, I have no idea what you're talking about, I've never felt the urge to shake,"" that's okay too. Sometimes we need to rebuild our connection to these natural responses.

Let's talk about boundaries for a minute, because they're intimately connected to somatic work. Many of us learned early on to override our body's boundary signals. You know that gut feeling that says ""nope,"" but you push through anyway because you should be ""nice"" or ""reasonable""? Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

Try this: Next time you're in a situation where you need to set a boundary, pause and check in with your body first. What's it telling you? Where do you feel the ""yes"" or ""no"" in your physical form? Maybe ""yes"" feels like an expansion in your chest, while ""no"" feels like a contraction in your gut. Getting familiar with these sensations gives us valuable data for making decisions that honor our needs.

Remember, all of these tools are invitations, not prescriptions. Your body, your rules. If something I've suggested doesn't feel right, modify it or set it aside. The goal here isn't to master some perfect technique - it's to rebuild trust with your own embodied experience.

And please, please be patient with yourself in this process. Our nervous systems have spent years, sometimes decades, operating in survival mode. It's okay if it takes time to shift these patterns. It's okay if some days feel like two steps forward and one step back. That's not failure - that's healing in action.

Trust me, I've been there, stumbling through this journey myself, feeling like I was doing it all wrong. But here's what I've learned - there is no wrong way to reconnect with your body. There's just your way, at your pace, with your unique set of experiences and needs.

You know what really gets me excited about somatic therapy? It's seeing how all these pieces we've talked about today start fitting together like this beautiful puzzle. When we begin tuning into our bodies, whether it's through gentle movement, breath work, or just sitting with those uncomfortable sensations, we're not just doing random exercises - we're literally rewiring our nervous systems.

And here's something I wish someone had told me years ago: this work isn't linear. Some days you'll feel incredibly connected to your body, like you're finally home after being away for so long. Other days, you might feel completely disconnected, and that's okay too. It's all part of the process.

What matters most is that you're showing up for yourself, creating that safe container where healing can happen. Remember those listener stories we shared earlier? Each person found their own unique way in - whether through dance, yoga, or simply learning to feel their feet on the ground. That's the beauty of somatic work - it meets you exactly where you are.

As we wrap up today's exploration, I want you to know that wherever you are in your journey, you're doing it right. Take what resonates from our conversation, leave what doesn't, and most importantly, be gentle with yourself as you navigate this path.

I'm Gregory, and you're tuning in to ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" Today, we're diving deep into something that might make your stomach do a little flip-flop – vulnerability in healing. Yeah, I know, I felt that collective cringe. But stick with me here, because this is where the real magic happens.

You know those moments when you're sitting in therapy, or maybe just alone in your car, and suddenly this wave of feelings hits you? That terrifying urge to let your walls down, even just a little? That's what we're talking about today. As someone who spent years building fortresses around my heart – and let's be honest, probably a moat with some very intimidating alligators – I get how scary this stuff can be.

Throughout this episode, we're going to explore why vulnerability isn't just some buzzword that self-help gurus throw around. It's actually a crucial part of healing from Complex PTSD. We'll look at how our survival mechanisms, while they protected us beautifully when we needed them, might now be standing between us and the healing we deserve.

I'll be sharing some stories from our community (with permission, of course) about their journeys with vulnerability, including some moments that'll probably have you nodding along thinking, ""Holy shit, that's exactly how I feel."" We'll also dig into some practical tools and techniques that have helped others navigate this territory – and don't worry, I promise none of them involve standing on mountaintops and screaming your feelings into the void (unless that's your thing, in which case, rock on).

By the end of our time together, you'll have a better understanding of why embracing vulnerability, as scary as it might feel, could be the key that unlocks parts of your healing journey you didn't even know were waiting for you. And remember, we're doing this together, at your pace, with all the compassion and understanding you deserve.

Let's dive in, shall we?

Alright, let's take a moment here to check in with our bodies, because talking about vulnerability can bring up all sorts of physical sensations that we might not even realize we're carrying. I know my shoulders are already trying to make friends with my ears, so let's do this together.

Take a breath with me - not one of those forced, yoga-instructor-style breaths, but just a natural one that feels comfortable for you. Notice where that breath goes. Does it stop at your throat? Maybe it makes it down to your chest? Or perhaps it travels all the way down to your belly? There's no right or wrong here - we're just noticing.

Now, while keeping that gentle awareness of your breath, let's do a quick body scan. I like to start with my feet because, let's be honest, they're usually the last thing we think about until they're screaming at us. Are they tense? Relaxed? Maybe they're tapping away without you even realizing it? Again, just noticing.

Move that attention up through your legs, your hips (mine are usually holding enough tension to power a small city), and into your belly area. This is where a lot of us carry our anxiety and fear around vulnerability. You might notice butterflies, tightness, or maybe even a sense of emptiness. Whatever you're experiencing, just acknowledge it with curiosity rather than judgment.

Let's check in with that chest and heart space. Given our topic today, there might be some interesting sensations here. Maybe a heaviness, a flutter, or what I like to call the ""emotional armor"" - that subtle tightening we do to protect ourselves. Just notice what's there.

Up through the shoulders (mine are finally coming down from their journey to my ears), neck, and jaw. These areas love to hold onto our stress like it's their job. See if you can let them soften, even just a little.

Finally, bring your attention to your face and head. Any tension in your forehead? Around your eyes? Sometimes we're carrying a whole facial expression we didn't even know about.

Take one more breath with me, and as you exhale, imagine creating just a little more space around any areas that feel tight or uncomfortable. Remember, we're not trying to fix or change anything - we're just practicing being present with whatever is here, just as it is. This kind of gentle awareness is itself an act of vulnerability, and you're doing it right now.

How was that? Sometimes just acknowledging what's happening in our bodies can help us feel more grounded as we navigate these challenging topics together.

You know, it's fascinating how vulnerability shows up differently for each of us in our healing journey. Just the other day, I was sitting with a client - let's call her Sarah - who had this profound realization. She said, ""Greg, I've been armoring up my whole life thinking it made me stronger, but it's actually been keeping all the good stuff out too.""

And that's the paradox we're dancing with here, isn't it? The very defenses that protected us when we needed them most can become the walls that block our healing. It's like we're wearing this heavy emotional hazmat suit - sure, it kept out the bad stuff, but it's also keeping out the sunshine, the fresh air, and the chance to truly connect.

Here's what trips many of us up: we think vulnerability means we have to bare everything all at once, like ripping off a bandage. But that's not how healing works, my friends. Real vulnerability in healing is more like... imagine you're slowly opening the blinds in a room that's been dark for years. You don't throw them wide open all at once - that would be overwhelming. You crack them just a little, let your eyes adjust, then open them a bit more when you're ready.

I remember when I first started this work on myself - and yeah, I'm laughing because I was terrible at it. I thought I was being vulnerable by intellectualizing everything. I could talk about trauma responses all day long, but actually feeling my feelings? That was a whole different ballgame. It took me years to realize that Published vulnerability isn't about having the right words - it's about being willing to sit with the messiness of our experience.

Let's get real for a minute - this shit is scary. When you've experienced complex trauma, being vulnerable can feel like you're voluntarily walking back into danger. Your nervous system is screaming ""What are you doing?! We built these walls for a reason!"" And you know what? That's a completely valid response. Those protective parts of us deserve our respect and gratitude.

But here's the game-changer - and I've seen this play out countless times in both my personal journey and with clients: When we create safe spaces to practice vulnerability, starting with tiny steps, something remarkable happens. Those walls we built? They don't have to come crashing down. Instead, we learn to install windows first, maybe a door, creating controlled openings where we choose when and how to let others in.

The beauty of this approach is that it honors both our need for safety and our desire for connection. It's not about demolishing our defenses - it's about mindfully modifying them to serve our present-day needs. Sometimes that means sharing a difficult emotion with a trusted friend, other times it's simply acknowledging to ourselves that we're struggling.

You know what makes me chuckle? How often we think we're alone in this process. Like we're the only ones fumbling around in the dark, trying to figure out how to open up without completely falling apart. But here's the truth - every single one of us is working on this in our own way. Even those people who seem to have it all together? They're probably sitting in their car having a good cry sometimes too.

Remember this: embracing vulnerability in healing isn't about being perfect at it. It's about being willing to try, to stumble, to sometimes take two steps forward and one step back. And that's exactly where the healing happens - not in doing it perfectly, but in showing up authentically for the process, messy as it may be.

So now that we've explored what vulnerability in healing looks like, let's actually put this into practice together. I want to share a simple but powerful exercise that's helped both me and many of my clients take those first wobbly steps into vulnerability.

Here's what we're going to do - and I want you to know it's totally okay if this feels a bit uncomfortable at first. We're going to practice what I call the ""Mirror Moment."" Find a quiet space where you can be alone for about three minutes. If you're driving or can't do this right now, no worries - come back to it when you can.

Stand or sit in front of a mirror - yeah, I know, some of you are already cringing, and that's completely normal. Look into your own eyes, and here's the vulnerable part: I want you to say out loud, ""I see you, and your pain matters."" Take a breath, and then add, ""You're doing the best you can.""

Now, if you're anything like me when I first tried this, you might feel ridiculous. You might laugh, or feel the urge to roll your eyes, or want to bolt from the room. That's all part of it. Those reactions? They're actually showing you exactly where your edges of vulnerability are.

Stay with it for just three minutes. If thoughts come up like ""this is stupid"" or ""I can't do this,"" just notice them. Those thoughts are your protective parts trying to keep you safe from vulnerability. Thank them for trying to protect you, and gently continue.

You know what's fascinating about this exercise? It's not actually about the words themselves - it's about staying present with yourself in a moment of deliberate vulnerability. It's about practicing being seen, even if it's just by yourself in the mirror.

I remember the first time I did this - I couldn't even get through the first sentence without laughing nervously. But each time I practiced, it got a little easier. And more importantly, it started to shift something inside. It's like building a muscle we never knew we had - the muscle of showing up for ourselves with compassion.

The beauty of this practice is that it's so simple, yet it touches on something profound. When we can be vulnerable with ourselves, it creates a foundation for being vulnerable with others. And that's where the real healing happens.

Try this once a day for a week. Some days it might feel easier, others harder. That's perfectly normal. Remember what we talked about earlier - it's not about doing it perfectly. It's about showing up, again and again, with willingness and courage.

And if you find yourself thinking ""This is too simple to make a difference,"" I get it. But sometimes the simplest practices can create the most profound shifts. It's like learning to walk - we start with tiny steps before we can run.

Let me share another practice that's been incredibly powerful for both me and many of my clients - something I like to call the ""Vulnerability Victory Log."" Now, before you roll your eyes at another journaling suggestion, hear me out on this one.

The thing about vulnerability is that we often only notice when it feels like it's kicking our ass, right? But here's the fascinating part - you're actually being vulnerable and brave dozens of times throughout your day, and you probably don't even realize it. Maybe you texted a friend when you were feeling low, or told your partner you needed a hug, or hell, maybe you just allowed yourself to cry during that commercial about rescue dogs - I mean, who doesn't, right?

So here's what we do: Every evening, take just a few minutes to jot down three moments from your day where you allowed yourself to be vulnerable. They don't have to be huge, earth-shattering moments. In fact, I encourage you to look for the tiny ones - they're usually the most meaningful.

What's particularly beautiful about this practice is how it starts to reshape your relationship with vulnerability itself. Instead of seeing it as this big, scary monster waiting to ambush you, you begin to recognize it as this quiet companion that's actually helping you connect more deeply with yourself and others.

I remember when I first started doing this myself - fuck, it was uncomfortable. My first entries were something like ""I admitted I didn't know how to use the new coffee maker at work"" and ""I asked for help reaching something at the grocery store."" But you know what? Those small moments matter. They're the building blocks of bigger vulnerability breakthroughs.

Over time, you might notice patterns emerging. Maybe you're more comfortable being vulnerable with certain people, or in certain situations. That information is gold, my friends. It helps you understand your own vulnerability landscape, showing you where you're already strong and where you might want to grow.

The real magic happens when you start seeing vulnerability not as weakness, but as evidence of your courage. Because let's be real - in a world that often encourages us to armor up and keep our walls high, choosing to be vulnerable is a radical act of bravery.

So grab a notebook, open a notes app on your phone, whatever works for you. Start tracking these moments. And remember, this isn't about judging or pushing yourself to be more vulnerable. It's about acknowledging and celebrating the vulnerability you're already showing up with every single day.

You know what's wild about this whole vulnerability journey? Sometimes the smallest moments of opening up can feel like scaling Mount Everest. And that's exactly where the magic happens - in those tiny, seemingly insignificant choices we make every day to show up authentically.

Let me share something personal here. Just last week, I caught myself doing that thing - you know, where you're about to share something real with someone, and your whole body goes into lockdown mode? Yeah, that. But instead of backing away, I leaned in. Told a friend I was struggling with some old trauma stuff coming up. And you know what? The world didn't end. Actually, it opened up a bit more.

Here's what I want you to take away from our conversation today: Your healing doesn't have to look like anyone else's. Maybe your version of vulnerability is simply admitting to yourself that you're tired. Or maybe it's finally letting someone see you cry. Whatever it is, it's valid as fuck.

Think of vulnerability like building muscle - you don't start by trying to deadlift 300 pounds. You start with what you can manage today, and you build from there. Some days you'll feel stronger, others you'll need to dial it back. That's not just okay - it's exactly how this process is supposed to work.

As we wrap up today, I want you to give yourself credit for showing up here, for being willing to explore this stuff. That itself is an act of vulnerability, and you're doing it right now. Remember, you're not alone in this journey - there are thousands of us out here, making sense of our shit together, one brave moment at a time.

This is Gregory, and you're tuning into ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" I'm sitting here in my studio today, feeling particularly connected to what we're about to dive into, because emotional stability - well, that felt like a foreign language to me for the longest time.

You know those days when your emotions feel like they're playing pinball inside your chest? When you're bouncing between feeling okay one minute and completely overwhelmed the next? Yeah, I've been there too. And that's exactly why we're tackling this crucial topic today: How to Build Emotional Stability in Recovery.

I'm especially excited about this episode because it's something that touches every single aspect of our healing journey. Whether you're just starting to understand your CPTSD or you've been working on recovery for years, emotional stability is like that foundation we're all trying to build - brick by brick, day by day.

In the next hour, we're going to unpack this complex topic in a way that actually makes sense. I'm going to share some real talk about what emotional stability actually looks like when you're dealing with CPTSD - spoiler alert: it's not about being happy all the time or never having bad days. We'll explore what's actually happening in our nervous systems when we feel like we're on an emotional roller coaster, and more importantly, what we can do about it.

I've got some powerful stories from our community to share - stories that I think many of you will relate to. We'll also dig into some practical tools and techniques that you can start using today. Not just the theoretical stuff, but real, hands-on strategies that have worked for both me and many others in our community.

The best part? Everything we'll discuss today is grounded in both trauma-informed research and real-life experience. I'm talking about approaches that acknowledge the unique challenges we face as trauma survivors, not just generic self-help advice that doesn't quite fit our experience.

So grab your favorite comfort item - whether that's a warm cup of tea, your trusted journal, or that super soft blanket you love - and settle in. We're about to embark on this exploration together, and I promise you'll walk away with concrete steps you can take toward building that emotional stability you've been seeking.

Remember, we're not aiming for perfection here - we're aiming for progress. And every step forward, no matter how small, is a victory worth celebrating. Let's dive in and make some sense of this together.

You know, when I first started working on my own emotional stability, I felt like I was trying to build a house of cards in a windstorm. Every time I'd get a few layers stacked, something would come along and blow it all to hell. And let me tell you, that feeling of constantly starting over? It's exhausting as fuck.

I remember this one particularly rough day when I was sitting in my therapist's office, probably looking like I'd been hit by an emotional truck, and she said something that really stuck with me. She said, ""Gregory, stability isn't about never wobbling - it's about learning to catch your balance faster each time."" That hit me right in the feels, because I'd been beating myself up for not being ""fixed"" yet.

Here's what I've learned since then - and what I really want to share with you today: emotional stability in recovery isn't some magical destination where you never feel overwhelmed or triggered again. It's more like developing emotional muscle memory. Just like you don't get physically strong by lifting weights once, you don't build emotional stability overnight.

The thing is, most of us with CPTSD grew up in environments where stability was about as common as a unicorn riding a skateboard. Our nervous systems basically got programmed to expect chaos. So when things are actually calm, it can feel weird as hell - even uncomfortable. Anyone else find themselves almost creating drama when things get too peaceful? Yeah, I see you. I've been there too.

But here's where it gets interesting - and honestly, kind of hopeful. Our brains have this amazing ability called neuroplasticity. It's like having a mental Etch-a-Sketch that we can actually redraw. The patterns that got etched into our brains during trauma? They're not set in stone. We can create new patterns, new pathways, new ways of responding to life's shit storms.

I was thinking about this the other day when I was doing something as simple as making my morning coffee. There was a time when even a small setback - like running out of filters - would have sent me into a spiral of frustration and shame. Now, most days, I can handle these little hiccups without feeling like the world is ending. That's stability in action, folks. It's not about never getting frustrated - it's about having a bigger emotional buffer zone.

Let me paint you a picture of what we're actually talking about when we say ""emotional stability."" Imagine you're standing on one of those balance boards - you know, the ones that wobble back and forth. At first, you're all over the place, maybe even falling off. But with practice, you start to find your center. You learn how to make smaller adjustments instead of wild overcorrections. That's exactly what we're working toward with emotional stability.

And just like with that balance board, everyone's journey to finding their center looks different. Some of us might need to start by just standing near the board, getting comfortable with the idea of stability. Others might be ready to try some fancy moves. Both approaches are perfectly valid, and both deserve respect and recognition.

What really gets me excited about this topic - and why I wanted to dedicate an entire episode to it - is that building emotional stability is something tangible we can work on. It's not some vague concept that only exists in self-help books. It's a skill we can develop, like learning to cook or ride a bike. Sure, we might skin our knees a few times along the way, but that's part of the process.

I think what trips a lot of us up is this idea that we should somehow naturally know how to be emotionally stable. Like it's something we should have figured out by now. But here's the truth bomb I want to drop: if you grew up in an environment where emotional stability wasn't modeled or was actively disrupted, how the hell would you know what it looks like? That's like expecting someone to speak fluent French when they've only ever heard German.

So as we dive deeper into this topic today, I want you to remember something crucial: wherever you are in your journey toward emotional stability is exactly where you need to be right now. Whether you're just realizing this is something you want to work on, or you've been at it for years, you're right on time for your own healing journey.

In the next part of our conversation, we're going to look at some real-world examples of what building emotional stability actually looks like in practice. Because let's face it - theory is great, but we need to know what this stuff looks like in the messy reality of everyday life.

So here's what I've noticed after working with hundreds of survivors - building emotional stability isn't some magical switch we flip. It's more like learning to ride a bike, where we start with training wheels and gradually build our confidence. And just like riding a bike, we're probably going to wobble and fall a few times before we get our balance. That's not just okay - it's actually part of the process.

Let me share something that happened to me last week that really illustrates this. I was in the grocery store, and someone's cart accidentally bumped into mine. Now, years ago, that would have sent me into a spiral of fight-or-flight responses - my heart racing, hands shaking, ready to either snap at them or bolt from the store. But this time, I noticed something different. Sure, I felt that initial jolt of anxiety, but I was able to pause, take a breath, and recognize it for what it was - just a simple accident.

That's what we're really talking about when we discuss emotional stability - it's not about never feeling triggered or anxious. It's about developing what I like to call our ""emotional shock absorbers."" Think about it like this: when you're driving down a bumpy road, your car's shock absorbers don't eliminate the bumps - they make them manageable. They give you enough control to navigate safely.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Greg, that's great for you, but my reactions feel completely out of control."" Trust me, I get it. When we're dealing with CPTSD, our nervous system is like a car with shot shock absorbers - every little bump feels like we're going to fly off the road. But here's the beautiful thing about our brains: they're incredibly adaptable. We can actually build new neural pathways that help us respond rather than react.

Let's talk about what this looks like in practice. One of my clients - we'll call her Sarah - used to have intense emotional reactions whenever her partner raised their voice, even slightly. Growing up in a household where raised voices always led to violence, her brain had learned that any increase in volume meant danger. The problem was, her partner would sometimes get excited and speak louder when talking about something they were passionate about, with zero aggressive intent.

Sarah started building her emotional stability by first learning to recognize her triggers. She noticed the physical sensations - the tightness in her chest, the urge to flee - when her partner's voice got louder. That awareness was the first step. Then, we worked on creating what I call ""pause points"" - little moments of conscious choice between the trigger and the reaction.

Here's where it gets really interesting. Sarah started using a simple technique I call the ""Reality Check Triangle."" When triggered, she would ask herself three questions: ""Am I safe right now?"", ""What evidence do I have about the current situation?"", and ""What would my wise self say about this?"" These questions became her emotional shock absorbers, giving her brain time to process the present reality rather than reacting from past trauma.

And you know what? It wasn't perfect at first. There were times when she still reacted from that trauma place, and that's completely normal. Building emotional stability isn't about getting it right every time - it's about gradually expanding our window of tolerance and building trust in our ability to handle difficult emotions.

I want to emphasize something really important here: this work requires immense self-compassion. We're essentially rewiring responses that our brains developed to keep us safe. Our nervous systems aren't broken - they're doing exactly what they learned to do to protect us. Now we're teaching them new ways to keep us safe that better fit our current reality.

Think about it like updating the operating system on your computer. The old system isn't bad - it did its job! But now we need something that can handle our current needs better. And just like with software updates, sometimes there are glitches and crashes during the process. That's not failure - that's just part of the installation process.

What I've found most powerful in my own journey, and what I've seen work for countless others, is focusing on small, consistent steps rather than trying to overhaul everything at once. Maybe today it's just about noticing when you're getting triggered without trying to change anything. Maybe tomorrow it's about practicing one deep breath before responding. These might seem like tiny steps, but they're actually laying the foundation for lasting change.

Remember, emotional stability isn't about never feeling strong emotions - it's about building the capacity to hold those emotions without being completely overwhelmed by them. It's about creating enough internal space to choose how we want to respond rather than being at the mercy of our automatic reactions.

And here's something that still amazes me: every time we practice these skills, even in small ways, we're literally rewiring our brains. Each time we pause before reacting, each time we show ourselves compassion after a difficult moment, we're strengthening those neural pathways that support emotional stability. It's like we're gradually building a more resilient emotional infrastructure, one moment of awareness at a time.

Now, I want to dive into some fascinating research that really validates what we've been talking about. You know how I'm always saying that healing isn't just this abstract concept? Well, science is backing us up here in some pretty incredible ways.

Let me tell you about this groundbreaking study from Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's team. In their research, published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress, they found that trauma literally changes the way our amygdala – that's our brain's emotional alarm system – responds to stress. But here's the hopeful part: they also discovered that these changes aren't permanent. Through consistent practice of emotional regulation techniques, participants showed measurable improvements in their ability to handle emotional triggers.

And you know what's really wild? A 2019 study in Frontiers in Psychology showed that even simple mindfulness practices – we're talking just 10 minutes a day – can significantly strengthen the connection between our prefrontal cortex (that's our rational brain) and our emotional centers. It's like building a better highway between our thinking and feeling parts.

I remember reading this research and thinking, ""Holy shit, this is exactly what so many of us in the CPTSD community have been experiencing!"" The science is catching up to what we've known in our bones – that healing is possible, and it's not just wishful thinking.

Here's something that blew my mind: Dr. Stephen Porges's work on Polyvagal Theory shows that our nervous system is constantly evaluating our safety through something called ""neuroception."" When we're working on emotional stability, we're actually helping our nervous system update its threat detection software. It's like we're teaching our body, ""Hey, it's okay to feel safe now.""

But let's get real for a second – because you know me, I love when science meets practical application. A longitudinal study from the University of California found that people who practiced self-compassion exercises – similar to what we talked about earlier – showed a 43% reduction in emotional dysregulation over six months. That's not just feeling better; that's measurable change.

And here's where it gets even more interesting. Research from the field of neuroplasticity, particularly work by Dr. Norman Doidge, shows that our brains continue to form new neural pathways throughout our entire lives. This means that no matter how long you've been dealing with CPTSD, your brain can still adapt and heal. It's never too late to start building that emotional stability.

Let me share something that really resonates with our journey. A 2020 meta-analysis in the Journal of Affective Disorders looked at various approaches to building emotional stability in trauma survivors. They found that combining different strategies – like mindfulness, somatic awareness, and cognitive reframing – was significantly more effective than using just one approach. It's like we've been saying: there's no one-size-fits-all solution.

The research also shows something fascinating about timing. Studies indicate that small, consistent practices throughout the day are more effective than longer, less frequent sessions. It's exactly what we were talking about earlier – those micro-moments of awareness and regulation add up to create lasting change.

You know what else the research validates? The importance of self-pacing in recovery. A study from the International Journal of Mental Health Systems found that trauma survivors who were allowed to control the pace of their healing showed better outcomes than those pushed into rigid treatment protocols. This is why I'm always emphasizing the importance of listening to your own timing.

Here's a piece of research that really hit home for me: a 2021 study showed that people with CPTSD who developed strong emotional regulation skills were not only more resilient to future stressors but also reported improved relationships and better life satisfaction. It's like emotional stability creates this positive ripple effect through every area of our lives.

And get this – researchers at Harvard Medical School found that consistent emotional regulation practices actually change the density of gray matter in areas of the brain associated with self-awareness and compassion. We're literally growing the parts of our brain that help us stay stable and connected.

But here's what I think is most important about all this research: it confirms what many of us have felt intuitively – that healing isn't just about managing symptoms; it's about fundamentally changing our relationship with our emotions and ourselves. The science shows us that when we practice these skills, we're not just coping better; we're actually rewiring our brains for greater resilience and stability.

And you know what makes me geek out the most about all this research? It's how it validates the messy, non-linear nature of healing. The data shows that progress isn't a straight line – it's more like a spiral, where we might revisit old challenges but with new tools and greater understanding each time.

This is why I get so excited sharing this stuff with you all. It's not just theory or wishful thinking – there's solid science behind these approaches to building emotional stability. And knowing that, knowing that research supports what we're doing here? Well, that just makes me even more passionate about continuing this journey together.

You know what's fascinating about this whole emotional stability journey? The way it spirals upward. Like, each time we work on these skills, we're not just moving in circles - we're building on what came before. And that's where I want to take us deeper, because there's this beautiful complexity to it that we haven't touched on yet.

Let me share something that hit me hard during my own recovery. I used to think stability meant feeling good all the time - which, let's be real, is about as realistic as expecting my cat to suddenly start doing my taxes. What I've learned, and what I really want you to hear, is that Published emotional stability is more like being a skilled surfer. You're not trying to control the waves; you're learning to ride them with grace.

Here's where it gets really interesting - and stick with me on this because it might sound counterintuitive at first. Sometimes, building emotional stability actually requires us to become temporarily less stable. Wild, right? It's like renovating a house. There's this messy middle period where everything looks worse before it gets better. When we start facing our triggers and processing our trauma, things can feel pretty chaotic. And that's not just okay - it's actually a sign of progress.

I remember working with this concept myself and thinking, ""Well, shit, Gregory, you've really done it now - everything feels more intense, not less."" But that intensity was actually my system recalibrating, learning to feel safe with feeling. It's like turning up the brightness on your phone to see the screen better in sunlight - temporarily more intense, but ultimately more functional.

Now, here's something that doesn't get talked about enough - the role of what I call ""emotional micro-adjustments."" Think about how you learn to ride a bike. You're not making huge, dramatic movements; you're making thousands of tiny adjustments that eventually become automatic. Building emotional stability works the same way. It's not about massive transformations overnight; it's about small, consistent tweaks in how we respond to our emotions.

Let's dig into this a bit more, because I think it's crucial. When we're dealing with CPTSD, our emotional regulation system often feels like it's either switched fully on or fully off - there's no dimmer switch. But here's the thing: we can actually install that dimmer switch. It's not quick, and it's not always pretty, but it's absolutely possible.

I had this client - let's call her Sarah - who made this beautiful observation. She said, ""It's like I'm learning to whisper to my emotions instead of shouting at them."" And doesn't that just nail it? We're not trying to strong-arm our feelings into submission; we're developing a more nuanced relationship with them.

This brings me to another layer that often surprises people - the role of play in emotional stability. Now, before you roll your eyes (I see you there), hear me out. Play isn't just about having fun; it's about creating a safe space to experiment with emotional states. When we can approach our healing with a sense of curiosity and playfulness, even just a tiny bit, we're actually engaging some pretty sophisticated neurological processes.

Think about it - when was the last time you allowed yourself to be silly? To laugh at yourself? To approach your healing with a sense of adventure rather than grim determination? I'm not saying we should make light of our trauma - hell no - but finding moments of lightness in our healing journey can be incredibly stabilizing.

And this connects to something else that's really important - the concept of emotional complexity. Often, when we're working on stability, we can fall into the trap of thinking we should only feel one thing at a time. But Published emotional stability actually allows for multiple feelings to coexist. You can be both grateful for your progress and frustrated with your setbacks. You can love someone and be angry with them. This capacity to hold seemingly contradictory emotions? That's not instability - that's emotional sophistication.

You know what really gets me excited? Seeing people start to grasp this. It's like watching someone discover they've had a superpower all along, they just needed to learn how to access it. Because here's the truth - building emotional stability isn't about becoming some zen master who never gets rattled. It's about developing a relationship with our emotional world that's flexible, resilient, and fundamentally compassionate.

And speaking of compassion - let's talk about how self-compassion plays into all this. Because if there's one thing that can sabotage our stability faster than anything else, it's being harsh with ourselves when we're struggling. It's like trying to learn to dance while someone's constantly stepping on your toes - it just doesn't work.

I'm seeing our time for this section winding down, but I want to emphasize something really important here. Building emotional stability isn't about reaching some mythical endpoint where we're always perfectly regulated. It's about creating a foundation that can weather storms, bounce back from setbacks, and yes, even grow stronger through challenges. It's about developing a relationship with our emotional world that feels like home - sometimes messy, sometimes peaceful, but always, always ours.

You know what really brings this home? The stories I hear from our community. Just last week, I got this incredibly moving email from Sarah - and she gave me permission to share this with you all. She wrote about how she used to think emotional stability meant never feeling anything ""too much."" Like somehow, she was supposed to be this zen master floating above it all.

But here's what changed for her - and this is where it gets really good. She started treating her emotions like weather patterns instead of personal failures. She wrote, ""Gregory, it hit me one day while I was actually watching a storm. The trees that survive aren't the ones that never move - they're the ones that know how to bend.""

That's some profound shit right there, isn't it? And it reminds me of another listener, Marcus, who shared his story during one of our workshop calls. He described how he used to white-knuckle his way through every emotional challenge, thinking that control meant suppression. But after working on his recovery for about two years, he had this breakthrough moment in, of all places, the grocery store.

He was there when someone's kid had a complete meltdown - you know the kind, full nuclear tantrum. And instead of getting triggered like he usually would, he found himself feeling compassion for both the child and the parent. But here's the really interesting part - he noticed his own body tensing up, acknowledged it, and consciously chose to relax his shoulders. He didn't try to force the tension away; he just noticed it, made space for it, and then made a choice about how to respond.

I'm sharing these stories because they illustrate something crucial about building emotional stability - it's not about becoming some emotionless robot or achieving perfect peace 24/7. It's about developing a relationship with our emotional world that's both honest and workable.

Then there's Jamie's story, which I think will resonate with many of you. Jamie had this habit of what they called ""emotional stockpiling"" - pushing down every feeling until they inevitably exploded. Sound familiar to anyone? They described it like trying to hold a beach ball underwater - the harder you push it down, the more forcefully it shoots up when you lose grip.

But here's where Jamie's story gets interesting. They started using this practice of what they called ""emotional check-ins"" - like having a daily coffee date with their feelings. At first, it felt awkward as hell (their words, not mine). But gradually, it became this powerful tool for preventing those massive emotional buildups.

One day, their boss made a passive-aggressive comment in a meeting - the kind of thing that would've previously sent them spiraling. Instead, Jamie noticed the initial sting, acknowledged it, and rather than immediately reacting or suppressing it, they gave themselves permission to process it later during their check-in time. That's emotional stability in action - not the absence of the feeling, but the presence of choice in how we handle it.

I've got to share Lisa's story too, because it shows another crucial aspect of this work. Lisa grew up in what she calls a ""feelings are weakness"" household. Every emotion except happiness was treated like a character flaw. So naturally, she became an expert at emotional suppression, wearing her ""I'm fine"" mask like armor.

The turning point came when her own daughter started showing signs of anxiety. Lisa realized she was unconsciously passing down the same messages she'd received. Talk about a wake-up call, right? But here's where her story gets beautiful - she decided to learn emotional regulation alongside her daughter. They started this practice of naming feelings together, using this silly game where they'd act out different emotions and guess what each other was feeling.

What started as a way to help her daughter became Lisa's own path to emotional stability. She wrote to me, ""I realized I couldn't teach my daughter what I didn't know myself. Now, we have this shared language for feelings, and sometimes she's the one reminding me to check in with myself.""

And you know what? That's exactly how generational healing works. It's messy and imperfect and sometimes we learn our best lessons from the very people we're trying to teach.

Oh, and I can't forget Alex's story - this one still gives me goosebumps. Alex had this brilliant insight about how building emotional stability is like learning to swim. At first, you're terrified of the water (emotions), then you learn to float (basic regulation), and eventually, you can navigate different strokes for different situations. But even Olympic swimmers can still get caught in a riptide - the difference is they know how to work with the water instead of fighting against it.

Alex wrote about how they used to see their emotional sensitivity as a curse, especially in their high-pressure job in emergency services. But through their recovery work, they've come to see it as their superpower. Their ability to feel deeply means they can connect authentically with people in crisis, and their practice of emotional stability means they can do so without getting swept away themselves.

These stories - Sarah's weather patterns, Marcus's grocery store epiphany, Jamie's emotional check-ins, Lisa's generational healing, Alex's swimming metaphor - they all point to the same truth: emotional stability isn't about controlling our feelings; it's about creating a sustainable relationship with them.

And you know what strikes me about all these stories? None of these folks reached some magical endpoint where they never struggle. Instead, they've developed something far more valuable - the confidence that they can handle whatever emotions arise, the wisdom to know that all feelings are temporary, and the compassion to be gentle with themselves through the process.

That's what real emotional stability looks like in recovery. It's not about never falling down; it's about knowing you can get back up, and maybe even learning something valuable in the process. And speaking of learning valuable things, let me share some specific tools and techniques that our community has found helpful in building this kind of stability...

So let's dig into some concrete tools that you can start using today. I want to share what I like to call the ""Stability Toolkit"" - and yeah, I know that sounds a bit clinical, but stick with me here because this stuff actually works.

First up is something I personally use every single day: the emotional weather report. Now, I'm not talking about checking your phone to see if it's gonna rain. This is about taking a moment, maybe when you first wake up or during your morning coffee, to simply notice what's happening in your emotional atmosphere. Are you feeling stormy? Sunny? Maybe there's some emotional fog rolling in? The beauty of this practice is that it helps you separate yourself from the weather - just like real weather, emotions are temporary conditions, not permanent states.

Here's what's really cool about this tool - and I learned this the hard way, trust me - you don't have to do anything about what you notice. The simple act of observing without judgment starts building that stability we're talking about. It's like having a weather station for your inner world.

Now, let me share something that might sound counterintuitive at first. One of the most powerful stability-building tools is actually planning for instability. I know, I know - it sounds weird, right? But hear me out. When I was first working on my own recovery, I used to beat myself up every time I had a bad day or got triggered. Then my therapist said something that changed everything: ""Gregory, what if we expected these moments and had a plan for them?""

This led to what I now call the ""Wobble Protocol"" - and yes, I totally made up that name because it makes me smile, and sometimes we need that in recovery. The idea is to create a simple, clear plan for those moments when you feel yourself starting to lose your emotional footing. Think of it like those emergency procedures on airplanes - you hope you never need them, but damn, it's good to know they're there.

Here's how it works in practice: You identify your early warning signs - maybe it's tension in your shoulders, a racing mind, or that familiar knot in your stomach. Then you create a three-step response plan. Mine looks something like this: First, I acknowledge what's happening - ""Okay, I'm wobbling."" Second, I use a grounding technique - usually putting my hand on my heart and taking three slow breaths. Third, I reach out to someone from my support network or use one of my pre-planned self-care activities.

Speaking of self-care, let's talk about what I call ""Non-Negotiable Nurturing."" This isn't about bubble baths or fancy spa days - though hey, if that's your thing, go for it. This is about identifying the absolute baseline activities that help you maintain stability. For me, it's getting enough sleep, moving my body in some way every day, and having at least one genuine connection with another human being, even if it's just a five-minute phone call.

The key here - and this is crucial - is to make these activities non-negotiable. Treat them like you would taking necessary medication. Because in a very real way, that's what they are - medicine for your nervous system.

Now, here's something that's been incredibly helpful for many folks in our community: the ""Stability Anchor Log."" This is where you keep track of moments when you felt stable, grounded, or managed to recover from a wobble successfully. The brain has this frustrating tendency to forget our wins and remember our struggles, so we need to actively counter that.

I remember one listener - let's call her Sarah - who started keeping her log on her phone. She'd just write quick notes: ""Made it through a difficult meeting without dissociating"" or ""Recognized I was triggered and used my breathing technique."" After a few weeks, she had this amazing resource of personal evidence that she could handle more than she thought.

Let me also share a tool that's particularly useful for those times when everything feels like too much: the ""Five Senses Check-In."" This is a variation on the classic grounding technique, but with a twist. Instead of just naming things you can see, hear, etc., you use your senses to find something that brings you a tiny bit of comfort or pleasure. Maybe it's the warmth of sunlight on your face, the smell of fresh coffee, or the texture of your favorite sweater.

The power of this tool lies in its simplicity and accessibility. You can do it anywhere, anytime, and no one even needs to know you're doing it. It's like having an emotional reset button in your pocket.

Remember, building emotional stability isn't about never experiencing difficult emotions or never getting triggered. It's about creating a foundation solid enough to weather the storms when they come. These tools are like the pillars of that foundation - the more you use them, the stronger they become.

And hey, if some of these tools don't resonate with you, that's completely okay. Recovery isn't one-size-fits-all. The best approach is to try different things, keep what works for you, and modify what doesn't. Think of it as creating your own personal stability recipe - one ingredient at a time.

Let's move on to explore some additional strategies that can help you maintain this stability once you start building it...

So let's dig into some additional tools that can really help cement this stability we're working on. You know, one thing I've learned both personally and from working with countless survivors is that stability isn't just about the big dramatic moments - it's about creating these small, reliable anchors throughout your day.

Here's something that's been incredibly helpful for me: setting up what I call ""stability checkpoints."" Think of them like those save points in video games - places where you can pause and recalibrate. Maybe it's when you first wake up, during your lunch break, or right before bed. The key is to make these check-ins brief but meaningful. Take thirty seconds to notice your breathing, scan your body for tension, and just get a read on where you're at emotionally.

Now, I know what some of you might be thinking - ""Greg, I can barely remember to eat lunch, let alone do emotional check-ins."" Trust me, I get it. That's why I suggest piggybacking these moments onto things you already do routinely. Like, every time you wash your hands, take three deep breaths. Or whenever you get in your car, spend the first few seconds grounding yourself before turning on the engine.

Let me tell you about something that happened with one of my clients - we'll call her Sarah. She was struggling with emotional flooding at work, those moments when everything becomes too much and you feel like you're drowning in overwhelm. We developed what she called her ""desk anchor"" - a small smooth stone she kept next to her computer. Whenever she felt those familiar waves of anxiety rising, she'd hold the stone, focus on its texture, and use it as a physical reminder to return to her breath and body.

This brings me to another powerful tool: creating environmental stability. Your physical space has a huge impact on your emotional state. Now, I'm not saying you need to go full Marie Kondo here, but having certain areas in your life that remain consistent and controlled can provide a crucial foundation when everything else feels chaotic.

For instance, I have this one corner in my living room - just a comfortable chair, a small table, and a lamp. It's my designated ""stability zone."" When things get overwhelming, I know that space is always there, unchanged, waiting for me. It's like having an emotional home base, if you will.

Something else that's been transformative for many survivors is what I call the ""future self check-in."" When you're making decisions, especially in moments of stress or uncertainty, ask yourself: ""What would my stable future self want me to do right now?"" It's a way of building trust with yourself and creating continuity between your present and future emotional states.

Let's talk about relationships for a minute, because they're crucial for emotional stability. Many of us with CPTSD have learned to either isolate ourselves or become overly dependent on others. The sweet spot is building what I call a ""stability network"" - a carefully curated group of people who understand and support your recovery journey. This isn't about having a huge social circle; it's about having reliable connections you can count on.

Here's a practical tip for building that network: start with one person. Just one. Be honest with them about what you're working on and what kind of support you need. Maybe it's someone who's okay with you sending a quick text when you're feeling wobbly, or someone who can remind you of your progress when you're stuck in a shame spiral.

Another tool that's been incredibly helpful is creating what I call ""stability scripts"" - short, personalized phrases that help you navigate triggering situations. These aren't generic affirmations; they're specific to your experiences and needs. For example, instead of ""I am safe,"" which might feel false in the moment, try something like ""I have tools to handle this feeling"" or ""This intensity will pass.""

Remember, building emotional stability is like developing any other skill - it takes practice, patience, and persistence. You're not going to nail it perfectly every time, and that's completely okay. In fact, those moments when things don't go as planned are valuable opportunities to strengthen your stability muscles.

The goal isn't to never feel destabilized - that's not realistic or even desirable. The goal is to build a strong enough foundation that when the waves come (and they will come), you have multiple tools and strategies to help you stay afloat and find your way back to center.

You know what's wild about this whole emotional stability journey? It's a lot like learning to surf. At first, you're just trying not to drown - and that's completely normal. But gradually, you start to recognize the patterns in the waves, you build those stability muscles we talked about, and one day you realize you're actually riding those waves instead of being crushed by them.

Look, I know some days it feels like you're right back at square one. Trust me, I've been there - we all have. But here's what I want you to remember: every single tool we discussed today, every strategy you try, every time you pause to check in with yourself - that's you building your emotional surfboard. That's you getting stronger.

And the beautiful thing is, you don't have to do this perfectly. Some days you'll nail it, catching those emotional waves like a pro. Other days, you'll wipe out spectacularly - and that's okay too. Because now you know how to get back up, how to recenter, how to reach out when you need support.

Remember, this isn't about becoming some zen master who never feels anything. It's about building a relationship with your emotions that feels manageable, authentic, and ultimately empowering. You're not broken - you're learning. And you're doing it brilliantly, one small step at a time.

Next week, we're going to dive into something really important - celebrating those small wins. Because trust me, they matter more than you think.

You're here with Gregory, and this is CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit. Today, we're diving into something that might feel a bit foreign to many of us - celebrating our small wins. And before you roll your eyes or reach for that skip button, hear me out.

You know those days when getting out of bed feels like climbing Mount Everest? Or when sending that one email takes more emotional energy than running a marathon? Yeah, those moments. The ones we usually brush off as ""just doing the bare minimum"" or ""nothing special."" Well, guess what? They are special, and that's exactly what we're unpacking today.

For those of us with Complex PTSD, our brains have been wired to focus on threat, danger, and what could go wrong. It's like having an overactive smoke detector that goes off when someone's just making toast three blocks away. This hypervigilance served us well during trauma, but now? It's making us miss the beautiful little victories that pepper our days.

Throughout this episode, we're going to explore why celebrating small wins isn't just feel-good fluff - it's actually crucial for rewiring our trauma-affected brains. I'll share some stories from our community (with permission, of course) that'll probably sound familiar to many of you. We'll look at the science behind why acknowledging our progress, no matter how tiny it seems, can create lasting positive changes in our recovery journey.

You'll learn practical ways to start recognizing and celebrating these wins without feeling silly or self-indulgent. And for those of you thinking, ""But Gregory, I don't have any wins to celebrate"" - stick around. I promise you'll start seeing them everywhere once you know what to look for.

So grab your favorite comfort item, settle in somewhere safe, and let's explore how these small celebrations can become powerful stepping stones on your healing path. Remember, you're not just surviving anymore - you're learning to thrive, one tiny victory at a time.

Now, before we dive deeper into celebrating those wins, let's take a moment to check in with our bodies. I know, I know - some of you might be rolling your eyes thinking ""Here goes Gregory with the woo-woo stuff again."" But trust me on this one, friends. Our bodies hold so much wisdom, and they're usually trying to tell us something important.

Take a nice deep breath with me. Not one of those shallow chest breaths we do when we're stressed - I'm talking about a real belly breath. Feel your belly expand like a balloon as you inhale... and then deflate as you exhale. No judgment here if your breath feels a bit shaky or if you're having trouble connecting with it. That's totally normal when we're dealing with CPTSD.

Notice where you are right now. Maybe you're curled up on your couch, or perhaps you're driving (keep those eyes on the road!), or maybe you're hiding in your bathroom for a moment of peace - wherever you are, that's perfect. Just notice the points where your body makes contact with whatever's supporting you.

Here's something interesting I've noticed in my own journey - when we start acknowledging our small wins, our bodies often respond before our minds do. You might feel a subtle release in your shoulders, a warmth in your chest, or maybe even a flutter of excitement in your belly. These physical sensations are like little high-fives from your nervous system saying, ""Hey, we're doing okay!""

Take another breath with me. As you exhale, see if you can let go of any tension you're holding - even just a tiny bit. Your jaw, your shoulders, your hands... wherever you notice tightness, send a little breath there. And if you can't relax right now, that's okay too. Sometimes being aware of the tension is a win in itself.

I want you to know that whatever you're feeling in your body right now - whether it's anxiety, exhaustion, numbness, or maybe even a spark of hope - it's all valid. Your body has carried you through so much, and it's still here, still fighting, still showing up. That itself is worth celebrating.

As we move forward in our discussion about celebrating small wins, try to stay connected to these physical sensations. Your body might have its own way of celebrating - maybe a spontaneous smile, a deeper breath, or even just a moment where your shoulders drop away from your ears. These are all tiny victories, my friends, and they matter more than you might think.

Let's take one more breath together before we continue. You're doing great, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

You know what's fascinating? When I first started my healing journey, I used to get so frustrated with myself for not making ""enough"" progress. I'd look at these massive goals I'd set - like ""never dissociate again"" or ""be completely healed by next month"" - and beat myself up when I inevitably fell short. Talk about setting yourself up for disappointment, right?

But here's where it gets interesting: our brains literally reshape themselves through small, consistent changes. Not the grand, sweeping transformations we sometimes dream about. It's kind of like trying to redirect a river - you don't do it all at once. You start with tiny channels, little by little, until eventually, the water finds a new path.

Let me share something that happened just last week. I was at the grocery store - you know, just doing that regular mundane life stuff - and I started feeling that familiar tension creeping up. In the past, I would've either pushed through until I was completely overwhelmed or just abandoned my cart and bolted. But this time, I noticed it. I actually noticed it before it got too intense. And you know what I did? I took a thirty-second break in the cereal aisle. Just stood there, breathing, while pretending to be really interested in fiber content.

That might not sound like much to someone who hasn't lived with CPTSD, but holy shit, friends - that was a win. That was me showing up for myself in a way that my younger self never experienced. And that's exactly the kind of small victory we need to acknowledge.

Think about it this way: If you were teaching a kid to ride a bike, you wouldn't wait until they could do a perfect Tour de France stage to celebrate, right? You'd celebrate when they balanced for three seconds, when they made it to the end of the driveway, when they got back up after falling. Our healing journey deserves that same kind of gentle recognition.

Here's what I've learned: these small wins compound. That moment in the grocery store? It built on hundreds of tiny moments before it - times when I practiced grounding techniques in less stressful situations, times when I simply noticed my triggers without judging them, even times when I messed up but showed myself compassion afterward.

And speaking of compassion - let's talk about how we often dismiss our progress because it doesn't look like someone else's healing journey. That's like comparing your chapter 3 to someone else's chapter 20. Your wins are valid precisely because they're yours. They're calibrated to your specific challenges, your unique history, your personal battle with CPTSD.

Sometimes a win might look like sending that email you've been avoiding for weeks. Sometimes it's setting a boundary, even if your voice shakes while doing it. Sometimes it's just managing to get out of bed when your body feels like it's made of lead. These aren't small things - they're evidence of you actively rewiring neural pathways that were shaped by trauma.

The beauty of celebrating these moments isn't just about feeling good - though that's important too. It's about creating new evidence for your nervous system that change is possible, that you're capable of growth, that you're worthy of acknowledgment. Each celebration becomes a tiny but powerful vote for your recovery, a small but significant step toward believing in your own resilience.

So let's put this into practice right now with a simple but powerful exercise I like to call the ""Win Window."" I want you to grab something to write with - don't worry, I'll wait a few seconds while you do that. Got it? Perfect.

Now, here's what we're going to do together. We're going to create a small window of time - just three minutes - where you focus entirely on identifying your wins from the past 24 hours. And I mean everything, my friends. Did you brush your teeth this morning? That's a win. Did you take a deep breath when you felt overwhelmed instead of spiraling? Absolutely a win. Maybe you sent that text you've been avoiding, or simply got out of bed even though your body felt like lead.

I'm going to be quiet for three minutes while you write these down, but before we start, I want to address something I know is happening in some of your minds right now. You might be thinking, ""Gregory, this is stupid. Getting out of bed isn't an achievement."" Or maybe, ""I can't think of anything good I've done."" I hear you. That inner critic is loud, I know. But remember what we talked about earlier - this isn't about meeting some external standard of success. This is about recognizing the courage it takes to keep moving forward when you're carrying the weight of trauma.

Let's do this together. I'm setting my timer for three minutes. Write down every single thing you've done in the last 24 hours that took any amount of effort, any choice you made that supported your wellbeing, any moment you showed up for yourself or others. No win is too small. Hell, write down that you're listening to this podcast - that's you actively engaging in your healing journey!

Okay, time's up. Now, here's the crucial part - and this is where most of us struggle - I want you to look at each item you wrote down and say, out loud if you can, ""I acknowledge this win."" Not ""but it should have been better"" or ""anyone could do this."" Just pure acknowledgment. Feel free to pause the podcast if you need more time with this part.

You know what's beautiful about this practice? It starts training your brain to notice these moments in real-time. It's like installing a new program that runs in the background, catching these small victories as they happen instead of letting them slip by unnoticed. And each time you acknowledge these wins, you're literally rewiring those neural pathways that trauma has distorted.

Try to do this Win Window exercise daily for the next week. You might feel resistant or silly at first - that's totally normal. But stick with it. You're not just collecting wins; you're building a new relationship with yourself, one tiny celebration at a time.

You know what else has been really powerful for me and so many folks I've worked with? Something I like to call the ""Anti-Shame Share."" Now, this might sound a bit strange at first, but stay with me here.

Here's how it works: Pick someone you trust - could be a friend, therapist, partner, or even a supportive online community. When you notice yourself achieving something that your trauma brain wants to dismiss, share it with them. But here's the key - you have to share it proudly, like you're bragging a little bit. Yeah, I know, that probably made some of you cringe just now. That's exactly why we need to do it.

Let me give you an example from my own life. Last week, I managed to get out of bed before noon three days in a row. Now, for some people, that might sound ridiculously basic. But for those of us who've dealt with CPTSD-related depression, we know what a fucking victory that can be. So I called my sister and actually said, ""Hey, guess what? I'm crushing it this week with my morning routine!"" Did it feel weird? Hell yes. Did I want to immediately follow it with ten reasons why it wasn't actually impressive? Also yes. But I didn't.

The magic happens when we push through that discomfort. Every time we deliberately celebrate something our shame wants to minimize, we're basically giving trauma the middle finger. We're rewiring those old patterns that taught us to hide our light.

What I love about this practice is how it creates this beautiful ripple effect. When you share your wins with someone else, you're not just healing yourself - you're giving them permission to celebrate their own wins too. It's like this gorgeous rebellion against shame, one tiny celebration at a time.

Start small. Maybe text a friend about making your bed or cooking a meal. Share in our online community about setting a boundary, even if it wasn't perfect. The size of the win doesn't matter - what matters is the act of claiming it, owning it, and saying ""Yeah, I did that.""

Remember, this isn't about bragging rights or comparing yourself to others. It's about reclaiming your right to feel good about your progress, to take up space with your joy, to let your wins be wins without qualification or apology. Because here's the truth - every time you celebrate openly, you're not just changing your own narrative; you're helping create a world where it's safer for all of us to acknowledge our growth, however small it might seem.

You know what I find fascinating? The way these small celebrations actually rewire our nervous systems over time. It's like we're creating new neural pathways - superhighways of self-compassion, if you will. And yeah, I know that sounds a bit woo-woo, but stick with me here.

Think about how many times you've dismissed your progress because it didn't feel ""big enough."" I did that for years. Hell, I still catch myself doing it sometimes. But here's what changed everything for me: I started keeping what I call my ""Tiny Victories Journal."" Nothing fancy - just quick notes about moments when I chose differently than my trauma responses would have dictated.

The first entry? ""Took a deep breath instead of immediately apologizing when someone bumped into ME at the grocery store."" Seems ridiculous now, but that moment? That was huge for my recovery journey.

So here's what I want you to consider doing this week: Pick one small win - just one - and really let yourself feel good about it. Maybe you set a boundary with your phone by not checking work emails after 7 PM. Maybe you allowed yourself to rest without feeling guilty. Whatever it is, give yourself permission to celebrate it fully.

Because here's the real magic - when we acknowledge these small wins, we're not just marking progress. We're actively participating in our own healing. We're telling our nervous systems, ""Hey, we're safe enough now to celebrate. We're safe enough to grow.""

And if you're sitting there thinking, ""But Gregory, I don't know if I can do this..."" - that's okay too. Start wherever you are. Even the thought ""Maybe I could try celebrating small wins"" is itself a win worth celebrating.

This is Gregory, and you're tuning into ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" You know, I've been thinking a lot lately about how we're all trying to navigate this recovery path, and one thing keeps coming up in our community - the desperate need for a solid self-care plan that actually works for people with CPTSD.

I can already hear some of you sighing, thinking ""Great, another person telling me to take bubble baths and do yoga."" But hang with me here, because that's not what we're talking about today. When you're dealing with CPTSD, traditional self-care advice often feels about as helpful as a chocolate teapot. We need something real, something that understands the unique challenges we face.

In today's episode, we're going to dig deep into creating a self-care plan that actually makes sense for people with CPTSD. And I mean really makes sense - not just some generic checklist that looks pretty on Pinterest but falls apart the moment you're triggered or experiencing an emotional flashback.

I'm going to walk you through what a CPTSD-specific self-care plan looks like, and we'll explore why the usual approaches often don't cut it for us. We'll talk about how to build a plan that takes into account your window of tolerance, your triggers, and your specific needs during different phases of recovery.

You'll hear some real stories from our community members who've figured out what works for them - some approaches might surprise you, and that's okay because we're all different. We'll also dive into some research-backed strategies that you can adapt to your own situation, and I'll share some practical tools that have helped both me and many of my clients.

Look, I know some days just getting out of bed feels like climbing Mount Everest. That's why we're going to focus on creating a plan that's flexible enough to work on your worst days and your best days. We'll talk about how to identify what you actually need - not what you think you should need - and how to build a sustainable practice that doesn't feel like another item on your to-do list.

By the end of this episode, you'll have a clear framework for developing your own personalized self-care plan, one that acknowledges the reality of living with CPTSD while giving you practical ways to support yourself through the healing process.

So grab whatever makes you comfortable - your favorite beverage, a cozy blanket, or maybe your trusted pet - and let's dive into making sense of self-care in a way that actually works for us.

You know, when I first started my healing journey, I thought self-care meant bubble baths and scented candles. Don't get me wrong - if those work for you, that's fantastic. But for those of us with CPTSD, we often need something a bit more... substantial. Let me tell you about the time I had what I now call my ""self-care wake-up call.""

I was sitting in my therapist's office, completely burned out, barely holding it together. She asked me what I was doing to take care of myself, and I proudly listed off all my ""self-care"" activities - meditation apps I never opened, yoga classes I kept meaning to attend, and journals I'd bought but never written in. She just looked at me with that knowing therapist smile and said, ""Greg, that's not self-care. That's a wish list.""

And damn, did that hit home. Here's the thing about CPTSD - it fundamentally changes how we relate to ourselves and our needs. Many of us grew up in environments where our needs were either ignored or used against us. So when everyone starts throwing around terms like ""self-care,"" we either dismiss it as selfish or turn it into another way to beat ourselves up for not doing enough.

Let me be really clear here - creating a self-care plan for CPTSD isn't about adding more items to your to-do list. It's about building a sustainable framework that helps you navigate life with this condition. Think of it like creating your own personal operations manual - except this time, you get to write it yourself, based on what actually works for you.

I remember when I first started developing my own self-care plan. It was messy, folks. Really messy. I had days where my idea of self-care was just managing to brush my teeth, and you know what? That was perfectly valid. Because here's what I've learned - self-care with CPTSD isn't about achieving some Instagram-worthy lifestyle. It's about meeting yourself where you are and building from there.

The tricky part about CPTSD is that it can make even basic self-care feel impossible. Our nervous systems are often so dysregulated that the mere thought of ""taking care of ourselves"" can trigger anxiety or shame. I've been there - that place where making dinner feels as overwhelming as climbing Mount Everest, where taking a shower seems like an insurmountable task.

But here's what changed everything for me: understanding that self-care isn't just about the actions we take - it's about the relationship we're building with ourselves. It's about learning to listen to our needs without judgment, about creating safety in our own bodies and minds. And let me tell you, that's a whole different ballgame from what most people think of as self-care.

I had this moment last year - I was having a particularly rough day, feeling triggered and overwhelmed. My old pattern would have been to push through, ignore the signs, and eventually crash. But instead, I remembered what we're going to talk about today. I stopped, checked in with myself, and realized what I needed wasn't on any conventional self-care checklist. What I needed was to sit in my car for 20 minutes, listening to terrible 90s pop music and letting myself feel whatever came up.

That's the kind of self-care we're going to explore today - the real, messy, personalized kind that actually makes a difference when you're dealing with CPTSD. We're going to look at how to create a self-care plan that doesn't just look good on paper but actually supports you through the tough stuff.

And listen, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Great, another thing I need to figure out how to do."" I get it. The last thing any of us needs is more pressure. But that's exactly why we need to talk about this - because when done right, a self-care plan isn't another burden. It's a lifeline, a framework that helps us navigate the challenges of living with CPTSD.

So in this episode, we're going to break it down into manageable pieces. We'll look at what self-care really means in the context of CPTSD, how to identify what you actually need (not what Instagram tells you you need), and how to create a plan that's flexible enough to adapt to your changing needs. Because if there's one thing I know about CPTSD, it's that our needs can change from moment to moment, and our self-care plan needs to be able to roll with those changes.

Let's get real about what it takes to create a self-care practice that actually serves us, rather than just adding to our stress. Because you deserve support that actually works for you, not just what works on paper.

So here's what I've learned after years of both struggling with and supporting others through CPTSD - creating a self-care plan isn't about making some pristine schedule that looks great on Instagram. It's about getting real with where you're at right now and building from there. And I mean really real - like ""sometimes I can barely get out of bed"" real.

Let me tell you about what happened when I first tried to create my own self-care plan. I did what probably many of you have done - I made this elaborate plan with morning meditation, yoga, journaling, healthy meals, and all that good stuff. You know what happened? I lasted exactly two and a half days before completely abandoning it because it was just too much. And then I felt like shit about myself because clearly I was ""failing"" at self-care too.

Here's the thing about CPTSD - it already comes with enough self-judgment and impossible standards. We don't need to add more pressure with unrealistic self-care expectations. What we need instead is what I like to call ""trauma-informed self-care."" This means creating a plan that actually accounts for our triggers, our energy levels, and those times when we're deep in an emotional flashback.

Now, this might sound obvious, but it took me years to figure out that self-care isn't just about the good days. It's actually most important for the bad days. Those days when your inner critic is screaming, your body feels like lead, and everything seems overwhelming - that's when you need your self-care plan the most. But here's the catch - it needs to be simple enough that you can actually do it when you're in that state.

I remember one of my clients - let's call her Sarah - who had this breakthrough moment about this. She was beating herself up because she couldn't stick to her ""wellness routine"" during her hard days. We worked together to create what she called her ""bare minimum plan"" - the absolute basics she could manage even on her worst days. Sometimes it was just drinking water and taking her medications. And you know what? That was enough. That was self-care too.

The real magic happens when we start building our self-care plan like a set of Russian nesting dolls. Stay with me here - I promise this makes sense. Your smallest doll is your crisis plan - the absolute basics you need when you're at your lowest. Maybe it's just breathing exercises and calling your therapist. The next size up might be your ""rough day"" plan - slightly more involved but still manageable. Then you have your ""okay day"" plan, and finally, your ""good day"" plan when you have more energy and capacity.

Let's get practical about this for a minute. When you're creating your plan, start with the smallest doll first. Ask yourself: ""What do I absolutely need to function?"" We're talking bare basics here - hygiene, medication, food, water, rest. Then, and only then, do you start building out the other layers.

Something that's really important to understand is that self-care isn't just about doing nice things for yourself - though that's definitely part of it. It's about creating safety for your nervous system. This means different things for different people. For some, it might be having a strict morning routine because predictability feels safe. For others, it might be having lots of flexibility because rigid schedules trigger anxiety.

I've noticed in my own journey that some of my most effective self-care practices aren't the ones you'd typically see on a wellness blog. Sometimes it's setting boundaries with people who drain my energy. Sometimes it's allowing myself to stay in bed for an extra hour when I'm overwhelmed. Sometimes it's ordering takeout instead of forcing myself to cook when I'm exhausted.

Here's a truth bomb for you: Self-care isn't always going to feel good in the moment. Sometimes it's about doing the hard thing because you know it's what you need. Like reaching out to your support system when shame is telling you to isolate. Or going to therapy even when you'd rather avoid dealing with your stuff. That's self-care too.

The key is to make your plan flexible enough to adapt to your changing needs, but structured enough to provide some sense of stability. Think of it like a choose-your-own-adventure book rather than a rigid schedule. You want options for different scenarios, different energy levels, different emotional states.

And remember, your self-care plan isn't set in stone. It's going to evolve as you do. What works for you today might not work next month, and that's okay. The goal isn't perfection - it's progress. It's about building a relationship with yourself where you learn to recognize and respond to your own needs with compassion and wisdom.

This might sound like a lot, and it kind of is. But we're going to break it down into manageable pieces. Because that's what this is all about - taking this overwhelming thing called CPTSD recovery and making it something we can actually work with, one small step at a time.

So let's dig into what the research actually tells us about self-care plans for CPTSD recovery, because - and I know this will shock you - there's some pretty fascinating science behind why this stuff actually works. And spoiler alert: it's not just about bubble baths and scented candles, though hey, if that's your jam, I'm not judging.

A groundbreaking study from van der Kolk's trauma center - and if you're new here, Bessel van der Kolk is basically the godfather of trauma research - showed that structured self-care practices significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in 76% of participants. But here's the kicker: it wasn't just any kind of self-care. The most effective plans incorporated what researchers call ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" approaches.

Now, I know that sounds like some kind of sandwich-making technique, but stick with me here. Bottom-up approaches are things that start with the body - movement, breathing, sensory experiences. Top-down approaches involve our thinking brain - meditation, journaling, cognitive work. And when we combine both? That's where the magic happens.

Recent research from the International Journal of Trauma Studies shows that people with CPTSD who implemented structured self-care plans were three times more likely to maintain long-term recovery progress compared to those who approached recovery more randomly. And look, I'm not just throwing these numbers at you to sound smart - this matters because it tells us something crucial: we're not just making this shit up.

There's this fascinating study from 2021 that particularly caught my attention - it looked at what they called ""recovery resilience factors."" They found that people who included all five key areas in their self-care plans - physical, emotional, social, spiritual (whatever that means to you), and practical life management - showed significantly better outcomes than those who focused on just one or two areas. And when I say significantly better, I mean like 65% better reduction in flashbacks and emotional dysregulation.

But here's something that made me laugh - in the best possible way. The researchers also found that perfection was actually the enemy of progress. Participants who aimed for ""perfect"" execution of their self-care plans actually had worse outcomes than those who approached it with what they called ""flexible consistency."" In other words, doing something imperfectly but regularly beat the hell out of doing it perfectly but sporadically.

Now, let's talk about the neuroscience for a minute, because this is where it gets really interesting. Dr. Stephen Porges - and if you've been with me a while, you know I'm a huge Polyvagal Theory nerd - his research shows that consistent self-care practices actually help regulate our nervous system over time. It's like we're literally rewiring our threat detection system. And that's not just fancy talk - they can actually see these changes on brain scans.

A 2022 study published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress showed something fascinating about timing. They found that small, frequent self-care activities throughout the day had a more positive impact than longer, less frequent sessions. It's like giving your nervous system little sips of safety throughout the day instead of trying to chug a whole bottle of calm all at once.

But here's what I think is really important - and this comes from a meta-analysis of over 50 studies on trauma recovery - there's no one-size-fits-all approach. What works amazingly for one person might be completely unhelpful for another. And that's actually backed by science! The research shows that the most successful self-care plans are the ones that are personalized to the individual's specific needs, triggers, and resources.

Here's something else that blew my mind: A study from the Complex Trauma Research Network found that people who included what they called ""micro-practices"" - tiny self-care actions that take less than two minutes - were more likely to stick with their overall plan. We're talking super simple stuff like taking three deep breaths before checking your phone in the morning, or doing a quick body scan while waiting for your coffee to brew.

And let me tell you about this really cool longitudinal study that tracked CPTSD recovery over five years. They found that people who regularly reviewed and adjusted their self-care plans - like, every few months - had better outcomes than those who stuck rigidly to the same plan. It's like our recovery needs evolve, and our self-care needs to evolve with it.

But perhaps the most validating piece of research I've come across - and this is from a 2023 study - shows that even small improvements in self-care consistency led to measurable improvements in quality of life. We're not talking about massive transformations here - even a 10% increase in consistent self-care practices was associated with significant reduction in CPTSD symptoms.

So what does all this research tell us? It tells us that we're not just throwing spaghetti at the wall here. The science backs up what many of us have learned the hard way - that structured, personalized self-care isn't just a nice-to-have, it's a fundamental part of CPTSD recovery. And most importantly, it tells us that we don't have to do it perfectly - we just have to do it consistently, in a way that works for us.

Now, here's something that took me way too long to figure out - your self-care plan needs to evolve as you do. I used to beat myself up when strategies that worked great for months suddenly felt... off. Like that meditation app that was my lifeline last year? Yeah, started feeling more like a chore than a refuge. And you know what? That's completely normal.

Let me tell you about what I call the ""self-care seasons."" Just like we don't wear a winter coat in summer, our CPTSD recovery needs different types of care at different times. Some days, self-care might look like getting out of bed and managing to eat something - and that's totally valid. Other days, it might mean tackling that art project you've been dreaming about or finally setting a boundary with that energy-draining friend.

Speaking of boundaries - holy shit, did I struggle with this one. For the longest time, I thought self-care was selfish, like I was somehow stealing time from more ""important"" things. But here's the mind-bending truth I finally got through my thick skull: setting boundaries IS self-care. When we say ""no"" to things that drain us, we're saying ""yes"" to our own healing.

So, let's talk about something that rarely gets mentioned in those glossy wellness magazines - crisis planning as part of self-care. Because let's be real, triggers and emotional flashbacks don't politely wait for convenient moments. They show up uninvited, like that relative who always crashes on your couch without warning. Having a solid crisis plan isn't being negative - it's being smart as fuck.

I remember one particularly rough patch where my usual grounding techniques just weren't cutting it. My therapist suggested something that sounded ridiculous at first - creating different levels of self-care plans. Like, having a ""green zone"" plan for good days, ""yellow zone"" for wobbly times, and ""red zone"" for those moments when everything feels like it's falling apart. Turns out, it was brilliant. Because when you're in the middle of an emotional storm, trying to figure out what you need is like trying to read a map in a hurricane.

Here's something else that blew my mind - self-care isn't just about managing the hard stuff. It's also about creating space for joy, even tiny moments of it. And I know, I know, when you're dealing with CPTSD, joy can feel about as accessible as a beach vacation on Mars. But that's exactly why we need to intentionally plan for it.

Think about it this way - trauma rewired our brains to expect danger around every corner. Creating deliberate moments of pleasure, safety, and connection is like being a gentle electrician, rewiring those circuits back to something healthier. Maybe it's five minutes with your face in the sun, or dancing badly to your favorite song, or petting that neighborhood cat that always seems to know when you need some furry therapy.

And can we talk about the guilt? Because holy hell, the guilt about taking care of ourselves can be overwhelming. That voice that says ""You don't deserve this"" or ""You're being self-indulgent"" - yeah, I know that voice well. It's like having an internal critic on steroids. But here's what I've learned: that voice is part of the trauma, not the truth. Every time we choose self-care despite that voice, we're basically giving trauma the middle finger.

Something else that's crucial - your self-care plan needs to include connection with others who get it. And I don't mean those toxic positivity folks who think you can just ""choose happiness"" and magically heal decades of trauma. I mean real, authentic connection with people who understand that recovery isn't linear, who won't judge you for having bad days, who get why sometimes you need to cancel plans because your nervous system is screaming.

Let's be honest - building a self-care practice when you have CPTSD is like trying to renovate a house while you're still living in it. It's messy, sometimes things get worse before they get better, and there are definitely days when it feels like everything's falling apart. But every small act of self-care is like adding another brick to your foundation of healing.

Remember this: your self-care plan doesn't have to look Instagram-worthy. It doesn't have to involve expensive spa treatments or complicated meditation routines (unless that's your thing, in which case, rock on). It just needs to work for you, in your real life, with your real challenges and limitations.

And here's something I wish someone had told me earlier - it's okay if your self-care looks different from everyone else's. Maybe your version of self-care is setting seventeen alarms because CPTSD messes with your sleep. Maybe it's having frozen meals ready for the days when cooking feels impossible. Maybe it's keeping a ""fuck everything"" playlist ready for emergency dance parties in your kitchen. Whatever works for you is valid.

The point isn't to create some perfect, unchanging routine. The point is to build a flexible, personalized toolkit that helps you navigate life with CPTSD. Because at the end of the day, self-care isn't about achieving some idealized version of healing - it's about supporting ourselves through the messy, beautiful, challenging journey of recovery.

You know what really brings this all home? The stories I hear from our community. Like Sarah's email from last week - she wrote about how she used to beat herself up for not having the ""perfect"" self-care routine. She'd see all these Instagram posts about morning meditation and green smoothies, and feel like a complete failure because some days she could barely get out of bed.

But here's what changed everything for her - she started small. Like, really small. She picked just one thing: keeping a water bottle by her bed. That's it. Just making sure she stayed hydrated. And you know what? That tiny action became her anchor. On really rough days, even if everything else felt impossible, she could still reach for that water bottle and think, ""Okay, I'm doing something good for myself.""

I got another message from Marcus that really hit home. He shared how his therapist kept pushing him to do yoga and journaling, and while those are fantastic tools for some folks, they just weren't working for him. He felt worse because these ""standard"" self-care practices weren't helping. Then one day, he realized that working on his car - something he'd loved doing since he was a kid - was actually his best form of self-care. The familiar smell of motor oil, the methodical process of fixing things, the sense of accomplishment - it was his meditation.

And that's exactly what we're talking about here, folks. Self-care isn't one-size-fits-all. Sometimes it looks like what Jen described in her story - she created what she calls her ""emergency toolkit."" It's literally a shoebox filled with things that help ground her during flashbacks: a smooth stone from her favorite beach, lavender-scented hand cream, photos of her dog, and a playlist of songs that make her feel safe. She keeps one at home and a smaller version in her car.

Then there's Alex's story, which I think many of you might relate to. They struggled with the concept of ""deserving"" self-care. Growing up in an environment where their needs were constantly dismissed, the very idea of taking care of themselves felt selfish and wrong. They shared how they started by reframing self-care as ""maintenance"" - like how you wouldn't feel guilty about changing your car's oil or charging your phone. This shift in perspective was huge for them.

I remember getting this powerful message from Rachel about how she had to completely reimagine what self-care meant during a particularly rough patch of depression. She said, ""Some days, self-care meant letting the dishes sit in the sink and ordering takeout. Other days, it meant pushing myself to cook a proper meal because I knew my body needed it. The real self-care was learning to listen to what I actually needed in each moment, without judgment.""

And that's such a crucial point, isn't it? The judgment piece. Maria wrote to me about how she used to have this all-or-nothing approach to self-care. If she couldn't do her full morning routine - exercise, meditation, journaling, healthy breakfast - she'd think, ""Well, I've already failed, so why bother doing anything?"" Now she celebrates the small wins. Maybe she only managed to brush her teeth and take her meds today - that's still self-care, that still matters.

I particularly love what David shared about incorporating his cultural practices into his self-care routine. Growing up in a Latino family, he felt disconnected from his roots after trauma. He found healing in returning to some of his grandmother's rituals - making tea from herbs she used to grow, playing the music she loved, cooking the recipes she taught him. It reminded me how self-care can also be about reconnecting with parts of ourselves we might have lost along the way.

And let's talk about what Katie discovered about timing. She used to try to force herself to do self-care activities first thing in the morning because that's what all the wellness experts recommended. But she's a night owl, and fighting her natural rhythms was just adding more stress. Once she started doing her self-care routine in the evening instead, it actually stuck. She wrote, ""I finally realized that the 'when' matters as much as the 'what.'""

These stories really highlight something important: self-care plans need to evolve as we do. Like Emma shared, what worked for her during the initial stages of processing her trauma looked very different from what she needs now. Early on, she needed lots of alone time and gentle activities. Now, she's gradually incorporating more social connections and challenging experiences into her self-care routine.

And you know what? That's exactly how it should be. Our needs change, our capacity changes, our circumstances change - and our self-care plans should reflect that. As Mike put it in his message, ""I used to think I was failing at self-care because I couldn't stick to one routine. Now I understand that adapting my self-care to match where I'm at is actually a sign of growth, not failure.""

These stories from our community really drive home what we've been talking about. They show us that there's no ""right"" way to do self-care, that it's okay to experiment and adjust, and most importantly, that we're not alone in this journey. Every single person who shared their story started exactly where you might be right now - trying to figure out what works for them, making mistakes, learning, and gradually building their own unique approach to taking care of themselves.

Now, let's roll up our sleeves and get into the nitty-gritty of actually building this self-care plan. I know some of you are probably thinking, ""Greg, just tell me what to do already!"" And I hear you. After all the theory and stories, it's time for the hands-on stuff.

Let's start with something I call the ""Body-Mind Check-In."" It's deceptively simple, but stick with me here. Take a moment right now - yes, literally right now, unless you're driving - and notice three things: your breath, your shoulders, and your jaw. These three areas tend to hold onto our stress like they're collecting frequent flier miles. Just notice them. No judgment, no trying to fix anything. This is your baseline, your starting point.

You know what's wild? Most of us with CPTSD spend so much time in our heads that we've practically sublet our bodies to our trauma. So this check-in becomes your anchor, your way of coming home to yourself. Try doing it three times a day - morning, afternoon, and evening. Set a gentle alarm if you need to. I used to have mine labeled ""Hey, you still have a body!"" because sometimes we need that reminder with a side of humor.

Here's where it gets interesting. After your check-in, rate your overall stress level on a scale from 1-10. Don't overthink it; your first instinct is usually right. Keep track of these numbers for a week. You'll start to notice patterns - maybe your stress spikes after certain activities or interactions. This information is gold for your self-care plan.

Now, let's talk about what I call the ""Emergency Kit."" This isn't your typical first aid kit, though Band-Aids are always handy. This is your personalized collection of comfort items and tools that help ground you when things get rough. Mine includes a smooth stone I found on a beach in Maine, a small bottle of lavender oil, and - don't laugh - a rubber duck. Yes, a rubber duck. It reminds me not to take myself too seriously, even in the midst of a flashback.

The key is to engage multiple senses. Something to touch, something to smell, something to look at, maybe something to taste - like those hard candies your grandmother always had in her purse. The science behind this is solid: engaging our senses helps pull us out of the trauma response and back into the present moment.

But here's the thing about self-care that nobody tells you: it's not just about bubble baths and scented candles. Sometimes self-care looks like setting boundaries that make you feel like a total asshole. Sometimes it's saying no to that friend who always drains your energy, even though you feel guilty about it. And sometimes - this is a big one - it's about letting yourself feel your feelings without trying to fix them.

Let me share a technique I call the ""Permission Slip Practice."" Remember those permission slips we needed for school field trips? Well, we're going to write ourselves permission slips for our feelings. ""I give myself permission to be angry about what happened."" ""I give myself permission to rest when I'm tired."" ""I give myself permission to not have it all figured out yet."" Write these down. Put them somewhere visible. Add to them as needed.

Another practical tool that's been a game-changer for many in our community is the ""Energy Account Balance."" Think of your energy like a bank account. Different activities either deposit or withdraw energy. The trick is to start noticing which is which for you personally. Maybe scrolling social media feels like it should be relaxing, but actually leaves you depleted. Maybe washing dishes while listening to a podcast actually helps you recharge. There's no universal right or wrong here - it's about getting to know your own energy economy.

Keep a simple note on your phone for a few days. Write plus signs next to activities that give you energy and minus signs next to ones that drain you. This isn't about judgment - some energy-draining activities are necessary parts of life. It's about awareness and balance. If you know you have a particularly draining activity coming up, you can plan to balance it with something energizing.

Remember, these tools aren't meant to be perfect solutions. They're starting points, experiments in getting to know yourself better. Some will work brilliantly for you, others might feel awkward or unhelpful. That's okay. That's actually valuable information about what your unique system needs.

And hey, if you try something and it doesn't work, that doesn't mean you're doing it wrong or that you're somehow broken. It just means that particular tool isn't the right fit for you right now. Think of it like trying on clothes - not everything in the store is meant to fit you perfectly, and that's totally fine.

As we wrap up this section on practical tools, I want to emphasize something crucial: start small. Really small. Like, microscopically small if you need to. One body check-in per day. One item in your emergency kit. One permission slip. Building a self-care practice is like building a house - you need a solid foundation before you can start working on the roof. And speaking of foundations, let's move on to some additional strategies that can help support everything we've talked about so far...

So here's something I've learned the hard way – and I bet many of you can relate – sometimes the most powerful self-care tools are the ones that seem ridiculously simple at first glance. Like, almost embarrassingly simple. Let me tell you about what I call the ""Five-Minute Reset."" When everything feels overwhelming, when your nervous system is screaming at you, sometimes all you need is five minutes of intentional presence.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking – ""Greg, I don't even have five minutes to spare."" Trust me, I get it. But here's the thing: this isn't about adding another task to your already overflowing plate. It's about creating tiny pockets of sanctuary in your day. You know those moments when you're hiding in the bathroom at work, or sitting in your car before going into the grocery store? Those are perfect opportunities for a reset.

Let me share something that happened just last week. I was having one of those days where everything felt like too much – you know the kind I mean. My trauma brain was serving up a greatest hits compilation of every mistake I'd ever made, and my body felt like it was made of concrete. Instead of pushing through like I used to, I stopped. Just... stopped. I put my hand on my heart, felt my breathing, and remembered what my therapist always says: ""You're having feelings, not solving problems right now.""

Speaking of feelings, let's talk about something that's been absolutely game-changing for many of our listeners – the concept of ""emotional weather forecasting."" This isn't about predicting the future; it's about learning to recognize your personal patterns and planning accordingly. Just like you wouldn't go out in a thunderstorm without an umbrella, you shouldn't face your known emotional triggers without proper preparation.

Here's what this might look like in practice: Maybe you know that Monday mornings are particularly rough for you because they remind you of stressful family situations. Instead of beating yourself up about it, you can plan ahead. Set your alarm fifteen minutes earlier. Have your comfort playlist ready. Put your coziest sweater where you can easily reach it. These aren't indulgences – they're strategic supports for your nervous system.

And you know what? Sometimes self-care looks like saying ""no"" to things that don't serve you. I had a client – let's call her Sarah – who always felt obligated to attend every family gathering, even though they left her emotionally depleted for days afterward. We worked together to develop what I call a ""declining with grace"" script. It's not about burning bridges; it's about building boundaries that protect your peace.

Now, let's talk about something that might sound counter-intuitive: scheduling worry time. Yeah, you heard that right. Instead of letting anxiety hijack your entire day, set aside specific times to process your concerns. It's like giving your worried mind office hours – ""I see you, anxiety, and we'll address these thoughts at 4 PM today."" This isn't about suppressing emotions; it's about containing them in a way that feels manageable.

One thing that's absolutely crucial – and I cannot stress this enough – is having what I call a ""self-care accountability buddy."" This isn't someone who's going to police your behavior or make you feel guilty. Instead, it's someone who gets it, someone who understands that recovery isn't linear, and someone who can gently remind you of your own strength when you temporarily forget.

You know what's funny? Sometimes the most profound self-care moments happen in the most mundane situations. Like doing the dishes – stay with me here. Instead of viewing it as just another chore, try turning it into a mindfulness practice. Feel the warm water, notice the soap bubbles, listen to the sounds. It's not about making the activity perfect; it's about finding presence in the ordinary.

And speaking of presence, let's talk about what I call the ""future self check-in."" When you're making decisions about self-care, ask yourself: ""What would my future self thank me for right now?"" Sometimes it's taking that nap. Sometimes it's making that therapy appointment you've been putting off. And sometimes – this is important – it's celebrating the small wins, like managing to brush your teeth on a really hard day.

Remember, creating a self-care plan isn't about achieving some perfect state of zen-like calm. It's about building a sustainable practice that can weather the storms of trauma recovery. Think of it like creating your own personal safety net, woven from all these different tools and strategies we've discussed. Some days you'll need certain strands more than others, and that's absolutely okay.

You know what really gets me excited about all of this? It's seeing how these self-care practices aren't just isolated activities - they're part of a larger story of reclaiming our lives. When we start putting these pieces together, something magical happens. The breathing exercises connect with the boundary setting, which flows into the mindful moments, and suddenly we're creating this beautiful tapestry of self-support.

Listen, I get that some days it feels impossible. There are mornings when just getting out of bed feels like climbing Mount Everest. That's exactly why we need this flexible, personalized approach. Your self-care plan isn't meant to be another source of shame or pressure - it's your lifeline, your permission slip to prioritize yourself.

The key is starting small and building gradually. Maybe today it's just five minutes of quiet breathing, or writing one kind thing about yourself. Tomorrow might look different, and that's perfectly okay. What matters is that you're showing up for yourself, creating that consistent message that you're worth taking care of.

Remember those listener stories we shared? Each one started with that first tiny step. That's all you need to do - just take that first step, however small it might seem. Your future self will thank you for starting this journey today.

Next week, we'll dive into dealing with triggers in daily life, which ties perfectly into everything we've covered today. Until then, keep being gentle with yourself - you're doing better than you think.

I'm Gregory, and you're tuning in to ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" Today, we're diving deep into something that affects pretty much all of us living with Complex PTSD – those sneaky, sometimes overwhelming triggers that pop up in our daily lives.

You know those moments, right? Maybe you're just going about your day, grabbing coffee, when someone's tone of voice suddenly sends you spiraling. Or you're in a meeting at work, and your boss's criticism – even if it's constructive – leaves you feeling like that scared kid all over again. These aren't just random reactions; they're our trauma responses showing up in real-time, and honestly? It's exhausting as hell.

In today's episode, we're going to unpack this whole trigger business in a way that actually makes sense. I'm not here to throw a bunch of clinical terms at you – though we'll get into some of that when it's helpful. Instead, we're going to look at how these triggers show up in our everyday lives, what they're trying to tell us, and most importantly, how we can start working with them instead of feeling ambushed by them.

We'll be hearing from some brave listeners who've shared their experiences – stories that I bet will sound familiar to many of you. And because I know we're all about practical solutions here, I've got some solid, real-world techniques that you can start using today to help manage these triggers when they pop up.

Look, I get it. This isn't easy stuff to talk about, let alone work through. But here's the thing – understanding our triggers isn't just about surviving them; it's about learning what they're teaching us about our healing journey. So grab your favorite comfort beverage, find a cozy spot, and let's figure this shit out together. Because while we might not have chosen our trauma, we absolutely can choose how we heal from it.

Before we dive deeper into today's topic, let's pause for a moment and do what we always do - check in with our bodies. Because here's the thing about triggers: they live in our nervous system, and getting grounded in our physical experience right now can help us engage with this heavy topic more safely.

So wherever you are - driving, doing dishes, hiding in your bathroom from your kids (hey, no judgment here, we've all been there) - let's take a few breaths together. If it feels safe, you can close your eyes. If that's not your jam today, just soften your gaze a bit.

Notice how your body is making contact with whatever's supporting you. Maybe it's a chair, the floor, your bed - just feel those points of contact. And yeah, I know some of you are thinking ""Greg, I'm literally scrubbing my bathtub right now,"" and that's perfectly fine too. Just notice where you are and how your body feels in this moment.

Take a slow breath in through your nose if you can, letting your belly expand like you're trying to fog up an imaginary window. Hold it for a moment - not straining, just a gentle pause. And then let it out through your mouth, like you're trying to make a candle flame dance without blowing it out. Do this a couple more times at your own pace.

Now, scan through your body, starting at your feet. Notice any tension, any holding patterns. Maybe your shoulders are trying to become earrings (mine totally were just now), or your jaw is doing that thing where it's trying to crack walnuts. No need to change anything - just notice what's happening in your body right now.

You might be aware of some activation as we talk about triggers - maybe a flutter in your stomach, a tightness in your chest, or that fun bowling ball of anxiety that likes to sit right in the solar plexus. That's all completely normal. Your body is doing exactly what it's supposed to do - it's communicating with you.

Remember, we're not trying to fix or change anything here. We're just creating a little space to notice what's actually happening in our bodies, rather than getting caught up in the stories our minds are telling us about what's happening.

Take one more deep breath with me. And as you exhale, just let your body settle into whatever state it's in right now. Perfect or messy, calm or activated - it's all welcome here.

Now that we've checked in with our bodies, let's explore how we can work with these triggers in a way that honors both our need for safety and our capacity for growth.

You know, I want to take a moment to really dive into something that I think gets overlooked when we talk about triggers - the absolutely wild intelligence of our nervous system. Like, seriously, the fact that we get triggered isn't a malfunction - it's actually our body's brilliant survival strategy working exactly as designed.

Here's what blows my mind: Every time we experience a trigger, our body is essentially saying, ""Hey friend, I remember something like this from before, and it wasn't safe then, so I'm going to protect you now."" That's fucking beautiful when you think about it. Misguided sometimes? Sure. But beautiful nonetheless.

Let me share something personal here. The other day, I was in a coffee shop, and someone dropped a metal tray. That sharp, clanging sound - boom - instant trigger. My heart started racing, my shoulders tensed up, and for a split second, I was right back in my childhood kitchen, where loud noises never meant anything good. But here's the thing - instead of beating myself up about it, I thought, ""Thanks, nervous system. You're trying to keep me safe. I see you.""

And that's what I want us to really get about triggers - they're not our enemy. They're more like an overzealous bodyguard who maybe needs some updated intel about what's actually dangerous in our current life versus what was dangerous in our past.

Now, this doesn't mean we have to like being triggered. Hell no. It sucks. It's exhausting. It can make us feel like we're constantly walking through a minefield. But when we start seeing our triggers as information rather than interruptions, something shifts. We move from ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"" to ""What is my body trying to tell me?""

Think about it like this: If you had a friend who kept warning you about dangers - some real, some not - would you just tell them to shut up? Or would you sit down with them, listen to their concerns, and gently help them understand which threats are current and which are echoes from the past?

The real mind-fuck of CPTSD triggers is that they collapse time. In an instant, we're both our adult selves and our wounded younger selves. The coffee shop becomes the kitchen, the friendly face becomes the threatening one, the present moment becomes every moment we've ever felt unsafe.

But here's where it gets interesting - and I mean interesting in that ""holy shit, our brains are amazing"" kind of way. Just as our nervous system learned to respond to these triggers, it can learn new patterns. Not overnight, not through forcing or shaming ourselves, but through patient, consistent reparative experiences.

And you know what? Sometimes understanding this doesn't make it one bit easier in the moment. Sometimes we're still going to get blindsided, still going to feel that rush of adrenaline, still going to need to step away and ground ourselves. And that's okay too. Because healing isn't about never getting triggered - it's about building a new relationship with our triggers, one that's based on understanding rather than fear.

Remember, your triggers are speaking a language - the language of survival. And while sometimes they might be speaking a bit louder than we'd like, or about threats that are no longer present, they're always trying to protect us. Our job isn't to silence them, but to learn their dialect, to update their information, and to gradually help them understand that we're safe now.

So let's put this into practice with something I call ""The Trigger Translation Exercise."" I know, I know – not the sexiest name, but hey, sometimes the most helpful stuff isn't wrapped in fancy packaging, right?

Here's what we're going to do together right now. Find a comfortable spot – and by comfortable, I mean wherever you are that feels safe enough to close your eyes for a few minutes. If you're driving or operating heavy machinery, just bookmark this for later because, you know, safety first and all that jazz.

Take a slow breath with me. We're going to think about a recent trigger that wasn't too overwhelming – maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 on your personal ""oh shit"" scale. Got one in mind? Good. Now, instead of trying to push it away or analyze it to death, we're going to get curious about what this trigger is trying to tell us.

Imagine this trigger is like a scared kid trying to warn you about something in the only way they know how. Maybe they're pulling the fire alarm because they smell smoke, even if that smoke is just from your neighbor's BBQ. Their intention is solid, even if their method is a bit... dramatic.

As you sit with this trigger, ask yourself: ""What is this part of me trying to protect me from?"" Don't rush to answer. Let it percolate. Maybe it's saying, ""Don't trust them – remember what happened last time?"" or ""Quick, get out of here before they reject you!"" Whatever it is, just listen without judgment.

Now, here's where it gets interesting – and stick with me here because this is the good stuff. Imagine you're responding to that protective part with the wisdom you have now. You might say something like, ""Hey, I hear you. You're trying to keep me safe, and I appreciate that. But we're not in that old situation anymore. We've got new tools now.""

Keep breathing. Notice how your body feels as you have this internal dialogue. Are your shoulders softening a bit? Is your jaw unclenching? These are signs that your nervous system is starting to get the memo that you're working with it, not against it.

This whole process might feel a bit weird at first – like you're having a conversation with yourself in multiple voices. But trust me, it's not weird at all. It's actually a pretty profound way to start building that bridge between your triggered parts and your present-day wise mind.

Take one more deep breath and slowly open your eyes when you're ready. How was that? Different from just trying to power through or shut down the trigger, right? This is the kind of practice that gets easier and more natural with time. It's like learning a new language – at first, it feels clunky and awkward, but eventually, you start dreaming in it.

Remember, you can come back to this exercise anytime. The more we practice translating our triggers, the better we get at understanding their protective intentions and helping them update their information about our current reality.

You know what's also really powerful when we're working with triggers? Something I like to call the ""Time Travel Technique."" And before you roll your eyes thinking I'm about to get all woo-woo on you, let me explain what I mean.

So often when we're triggered, we're not actually responding to what's happening right now - we're responding to something that happened years or even decades ago. Our nervous system is basically running an old program, like trying to play a Nintendo game on a PS5. It just doesn't quite translate, right?

Here's what I want you to try next time you feel that familiar trigger response bubbling up. First, acknowledge where you are right now - literally, physically, in this moment. Maybe you're sitting at your desk, or standing in line at the grocery store, or dealing with your partner's raised voice during an argument. Whatever it is, plant yourself firmly in the present.

Then, gently ask yourself: ""How old does this feeling feel?"" Not how old are you, but how old is this reaction? Sometimes it might feel like you're five, or twelve, or sixteen. That's your trigger time stamp - the age when this protective response first got coded into your system.

Now here's where it gets interesting - and I know this might sound a bit strange at first, but stick with me. Once you identify that age, imagine your current self showing up next to that younger you. What would you tell them? What do they need to hear? What resources do you have now that you didn't have then?

I had a client - let's call her Sarah - who would freeze up completely during work presentations. When we did this exercise, she realized she felt exactly like she did at eight years old, being forced to read aloud in class while kids snickered at her stutter. Adult Sarah was able to tell eight-year-old Sarah, ""We got speech therapy. We're actually really good at public speaking now. And these people in the conference room are our colleagues, not bullies.""

The beauty of this practice is that it helps create a bridge between past and present. It's like your adult self can loan your triggered self all the tools, wisdom, and perspective you've gained since that original moment. And let me tell you, that's some powerful shit right there.

Remember, you're not trying to erase or override the trigger - you're helping it update its data, like installing a critical software update. Your protective responses aren't wrong; they're just working with outdated information.

You know what I love about this work? It's not about becoming some enlightened zen master who never gets triggered. It's about getting real with ourselves and building a life that actually works for us, messy parts and all.

Here's what I want you to take away from our conversation today: You're not broken. Your triggers aren't character flaws - they're survival skills that helped you get through some really tough shit. And now you're learning to update those skills for your current life. That's not just healing; that's evolution, my friend.

Start small. Maybe tomorrow morning, when you feel that familiar tension creeping in, just pause. Take that breath we practiced. Notice where you are right now, in this moment. That's it. That's your win for the day. Because each time you do that, you're literally rewiring those neural pathways we talked about.

And hey, you're going to mess up. I still mess up, and I've been at this for years. The other day, I completely lost my shit over a coffee maker that wouldn't work - full-on trauma response over cold coffee. But you know what? I caught myself, used the tools we discussed, and managed to laugh about it later. That's the real victory - not perfection, but progress.

Remember, you're not alone in this. Every time you practice these skills, you're joining thousands of others who are doing the same work, figuring out their shit one trigger at a time. We're all in this together, learning to dance with our triggers instead of being bulldozed by them.

It's Gregory here, and I gotta tell you - today's episode is one that's particularly close to my heart. We're diving deep into something that I know many of you have been asking about: healing your inner child and developing that oh-so-crucial self-compassion that, let's be honest, most of us with CPTSD struggle with.

You know those moments when you find yourself reacting to something in a way that feels... bigger than the situation calls for? Like when a minor criticism sends you spiraling, or when you catch yourself people-pleasing to the point of exhaustion? Yeah, that's often your inner child calling out for attention and healing. And today, we're gonna make sense of all that shit together.

I remember sitting in my therapist's office years ago, rolling my eyes when she first brought up the concept of the ""inner child."" I was like, ""Come on, I'm a grown-ass adult dealing with serious trauma here."" But let me tell you something - understanding and healing that wounded part of ourselves is absolutely fundamental to our recovery from complex trauma. And I promise, by the end of this episode, you'll understand exactly why.

Throughout our time together today, we're going to explore what inner child work actually means - and no, it's not about sitting around hugging teddy bears (though hey, if that helps, no judgment here). We'll look at how trauma impacts that younger part of ourselves and why developing self-compassion isn't just some fluffy concept, but a vital survival skill.

I'll be sharing some powerful stories from our community - with permission, of course - about their experiences with inner child work. These stories really highlight how universal these struggles are, and more importantly, how healing is possible. We'll also dig into some practical techniques that you can start using today, backed by solid trauma research, because I know you're here for real solutions, not just theory.

By the way, I've got some fantastic resources lined up for you, including some game-changing books and exercises that have helped both me and many of my clients. And don't worry - I'll break everything down into manageable pieces, because I know how overwhelming this work can feel.

So grab your favorite comfort beverage (I've got my trusty coffee right here), find a cozy spot, and let's explore this together. Remember, you're not alone in this - we're all figuring this shit out one step at a time. And today's episode? It's going to be a big step forward in understanding and healing that precious inner child of yours.

You know, it's funny - when I first heard about ""inner child work,"" I'll admit I rolled my eyes pretty hard. Like, seriously? I'm a grown-ass adult dealing with some heavy trauma shit, and you want me to what... play with crayons? But damn, was I wrong about that one. And I mean monumentally wrong.

Let me tell you about the moment it clicked for me. I was sitting in my therapist's office, probably giving her my usual skeptical look, when she asked me to think about little Gregory - that kid who used to hide in his closet during his parents' fights. And suddenly, I felt this overwhelming wave of... well, everything. Sadness, protection, anger - all for that scared little kid who didn't deserve any of what happened to him.

Here's the thing about trauma - it doesn't just happen to us once and then politely excuse itself. It gets stuck in there, especially when it happens during those formative years when we're still figuring out how the world works. And that younger version of ourselves? They're still in there, carrying all that pain, all those misconceptions about safety, love, and self-worth that we picked up while trying to survive.

Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, ""Greg, this sounds like some new-age bullshit."" Trust me, I get it. But stick with me here, because this isn't about regression therapy or anything woo-woo. This is about understanding a fundamental truth: that part of you that's hurting, that part that reacts so strongly to certain triggers? It's often that younger version of yourself that never got the chance to heal.

The wild part is how this shows up in our daily lives. Maybe you find yourself people-pleasing to the point of exhaustion, just like you did to keep the peace as a kid. Or perhaps you have this knee-jerk reaction to shut down emotionally when conflict arises, because that's what kept you safe when you were small. These aren't character flaws - they're survival mechanisms that served their purpose back then but might not be serving us so well now.

And that's where self-compassion comes in. God, I used to be allergic to that word. Compassion? For myself? That felt like weakness, like giving in. But here's the perspective shift that changed everything for me: If you saw a child going through what you went through, would you judge them? Would you tell them to ""just get over it"" or ""toughen up""? Hell no. You'd want to protect them, comfort them, tell them it wasn't their fault.

So why do we treat ourselves so differently? Why do we berate ourselves for having these perfectly natural responses to trauma? It's like we're continuing the work of our abusers, our neglectors, our critics - but now we're doing it to ourselves. And that's some bullshit we need to address.

The beauty of combining inner child work with self-compassion is that it gives us a practical framework for healing. It's not about wallowing in the past or blaming everyone else for our problems. It's about acknowledging what happened, understanding how it affected us, and then - this is the crucial part - learning to respond to ourselves with the kindness and understanding we deserved back then.

I remember the first time I actually tried talking to my inner child. I felt ridiculous, sitting there in my apartment, eyes closed, trying to visualize little me. But then something shifted. I started thinking about what that kid needed to hear - not what anyone else thought he should hear, but what he actually needed. And holy shit, the tears came. Not the usual angry tears or frustrated tears, but healing tears. Because for maybe the first time, I was giving that scared, confused kid what he needed most: understanding, acceptance, and love.

That's what we're going to explore today - how to recognize when our inner child is calling out for help, how to respond with compassion instead of criticism, and most importantly, how to start healing those old wounds that keep showing up in our adult lives. Because here's the truth: you can't bully yourself into healing. Trust me, I've tried. The only way forward is through understanding and compassion.

And look, I know this isn't easy work. It can feel vulnerable as hell, and sometimes it might seem easier to just keep pushing those feelings down. But I promise you, meeting yourself with kindness, especially those younger parts that carried so much pain, is some of the most transformative work you can do.

So let's dive deeper into this together, shall we? Because your inner child - that part of you that holds both the wounds and the wonder - deserves to be heard, understood, and healed.

You know, one of the most profound moments in my own healing journey came when I realized that my inner child wasn't just some therapeutic concept - it was a very real part of me that was still carrying around a backpack full of unprocessed pain. And here's what blew my mind: this little guy inside wasn't stuck in the past because he was stubborn or broken - he was stuck because no one had ever shown him how to move forward.

Let me tell you something that might resonate with you. When we're dealing with childhood trauma, we often try to muscle through it with our adult brain, right? We think, ""I'm grown now, I should be over this."" But that's like trying to console a crying toddler with a PowerPoint presentation on emotional regulation. It just doesn't work that way.

The thing is, trauma gets stored in our bodies and our emotional memory at the age we experienced it. So if something scary or overwhelming happened when you were six, there's still a six-year-old part of you that's trying to make sense of it all. And that part? They're not going to respond to logical arguments or tough love.

Here's where it gets really interesting - and I see this all the time in my own work and with clients. We develop these sophisticated adult coping mechanisms, right? Maybe we become super achievers, or we perfect the art of people-pleasing, or we build these fortress-like walls around ourselves. But underneath all that armor, there's still this little one who's just waiting for someone to say, ""Hey, I see you. What happened to you wasn't okay. And it wasn't your fault.""

Now, I want to share something personal here, because I think it might help illustrate this. I remember the first time I really connected with my inner child parts. I was sitting in my therapist's office, feeling pretty skeptical about the whole thing, if I'm honest. But she asked me to close my eyes and imagine myself at the age when I felt most vulnerable. And holy shit, folks - suddenly I could see this little boy, sitting alone in his room, trying so hard to be quiet and good and invisible. And you know what? I started crying right there in that office, because for the first time, I wasn't looking at that memory from the outside - I was feeling what that little boy felt.

That's the thing about inner child work - it's not just about remembering or understanding. It's about reconnecting with these younger parts of ourselves and becoming the safe adult they never had. And yes, I know how woo-woo that might sound to some of you. Trust me, I was the king of eye-rolling when I first heard about this stuff. But the science backs this up - when we create new, nurturing experiences for these younger parts, we literally help rewire our nervous system.

So how do we actually do this? Well, it starts with something that might feel really uncomfortable at first - listening. Just listening to these younger parts without trying to fix or change anything. Because chances are, they've been shouting for attention for years, but we've gotten really good at drowning them out with busyness, or alcohol, or whatever our poison of choice might be.

And here's where self-compassion comes in - because let me tell you, when you first start hearing what these younger parts have to say, it can be overwhelming. You might feel waves of grief, or anger, or shame. That's normal. That's human. And that's exactly when you need to bring in that gentle, nurturing presence the most.

I often tell people to imagine how they'd respond to a real child who'd been through what they've been through. Would you tell that child to ""get over it""? Would you shame them for feeling scared or sad? Of course not. You'd probably want to sit with them, maybe give them a hug, tell them it's okay to feel what they're feeling. That's the kind of energy we need to bring to our inner child work.

Now, I want to acknowledge something here - this isn't easy work. There might be days when it feels like you're opening Pandora's box, and you wonder if you should've just left well enough alone. But here's what I've learned: those younger parts of us? They're already affecting our lives whether we acknowledge them or not. They're in our relationships, our decisions, our reactions to stress - they're running the show from behind the scenes.

By turning toward them with compassion and curiosity, we're not creating new problems - we're finally giving ourselves a chance to heal the old ones. And yes, it can feel messy and uncomfortable at times. But you know what? Healing usually does. It's like cleaning out an infected wound - it might hurt like hell in the moment, but it's the only way to truly heal.

And listen, you don't have to do this perfectly. In fact, perfection is often just another form of self-abandonment. This is about progress, not perfection. It's about building a relationship with yourself that's based on understanding and compassion, rather than criticism and shame.

So let's dive into what the research actually tells us about this inner child work, because I know some of you might be thinking, ""Greg, this sounds nice and all, but where's the science behind it?"" And honestly, that's a fair question – I geek out on the research too.

Here's what's fascinating: studies in neuroscience have actually validated what many of us have felt intuitively about inner child healing. A groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine showed that adults who practiced self-compassion – a key component of inner child work – demonstrated significantly lower levels of anxiety and depression compared to those who maintained self-critical patterns.

But it gets even more interesting. Dr. Bruce Perry's research on the neurosequential model of therapeutics has shown that when we're working with trauma, we need to meet our nervous system where it was when the trauma occurred. In other words, connecting with our inner child isn't just some fluffy concept – it's neurologically sound practice.

You know what really blew my mind? A 2019 study in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that inner child work, when combined with traditional therapy, led to a 40% greater reduction in CPTSD symptoms compared to traditional therapy alone. And let me tell you, when I first read that, I had to sit with it for a minute because it validated so much of what I'd experienced personally.

Now, let's talk about attachment theory for a second, because this is where it gets really good. The work of Dr. Dan Siegel – and if you haven't read his stuff, holy shit, you're in for a treat – shows that we can actually rewire our attachment patterns through consistent self-parenting practices. It's like we're giving ourselves the secure base we might not have had as kids.

And here's something that might surprise you: research from the field of psychoneuroimmunology – yeah, try saying that three times fast – has shown that emotional neglect in childhood can actually affect our immune system functioning as adults. But here's the hopeful part: studies have shown that self-compassion practices can help regulate our immune response. It's like our bodies are literally healing from the inside out.

You want to know what's really wild? A longitudinal study tracking individuals over 15 years found that those who engaged in regular inner child work showed improved emotional regulation, better relationship satisfaction, and – get this – even better physical health outcomes. The mind-body connection is no joke, folks.

But let me break this down into something really practical. Dr. Kristin Neff's research has shown that self-compassion – which is essentially what we're doing when we're caring for our inner child – activates the mammalian caregiving system. This is the same system that gets triggered when we're taking care of a child or pet. It releases oxytocin and opiates in our brain, literally helping us feel safer and more secure.

And for those of you dealing with shame – which, let's be real, is pretty much all of us with CPTSD – the research is particularly encouraging. Studies have shown that shame resilience, which we build through inner child work, actually changes the way our brains process negative self-talk. It's like installing a new operating system that finally works for us instead of against us.

Listen, I know some of you might be thinking, ""But Greg, my trauma is too deep for this to work."" Here's the thing: a 2020 meta-analysis of trauma treatment approaches showed that even individuals with severe, complex trauma showed significant improvement when incorporating inner child work into their healing journey. The key finding was that it wasn't about the severity of the trauma – it was about consistency in practice.

And this part really gets me excited: recent neuroimaging studies have shown that when we practice self-compassion and inner child work, we actually see changes in the brain's default mode network – that's the part of our brain that's active when we're not focused on the outside world. It's like we're literally rewiring our internal dialogue.

The research also shows something really important about timing: healing happens in layers. A study in the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation found that successful inner child work often follows a pattern of two steps forward, one step back. And honestly, I find that so validating because it matches what I've seen in my own healing journey and what I've heard from so many of you.

But here's what I think is the most important piece of all this research: it consistently shows that healing is possible. We're not stuck with the patterns we developed to survive. Our brains have this amazing capacity for neuroplasticity – the ability to create new neural pathways – well into adulthood. And every time we show up for our inner child with compassion and understanding, we're literally creating new pathways in our brain.

And you know what? That's exactly what we're going to explore in our next segment – the practical tools and resources that can help you put all this research into action in your own life. Because while the science is fascinating, what really matters is how we can use it to create real change in our daily lives.

So here's where things get really interesting – and maybe a bit uncomfortable, but in that good way that means we're growing. You know how we just talked about the research backing up inner child work? Well, let me share something that knocked me on my ass when I first discovered it in my own healing journey.

Many of us who've experienced trauma, especially the complex kind that happens in childhood, develop what I call a ""protective perfectionist."" It's this part of us that basically says, ""If I just do everything exactly right, if I'm perfect enough, then I'll finally be safe and loved."" And while that might have helped us survive some really tough situations, it becomes this massive obstacle when we're trying to show compassion to our inner child.

Here's the mindfuck – and yeah, I'm gonna call it that because that's exactly what it is: The very part of us that's trying to keep us safe is often the same part that's blocking us from healing. It's like having an overprotective bouncer at the door of your heart who's so focused on keeping the bad stuff out that they're also blocking all the good stuff from getting in.

Now, I remember working with a client – let's call her Sarah – who was absolutely crushing it in her career but felt completely disconnected from her emotions. She had this moment in therapy where she realized that her inner achiever, the part that made her so successful, was actually the same part that was keeping her from feeling safe enough to be vulnerable with herself. Mind-blowing, right?

The thing is, we can't bully or perfect our way into self-compassion. Trust me, I've tried – and holy shit, did that not work. It's like trying to force yourself to fall asleep – the harder you try, the more awake you become. Instead, what we need to do is create what I call ""compassionate curiosity.""

Let me break this down a bit. When you're working with your inner child, you might notice this intense resistance come up. Maybe you feel silly talking to yourself, or you hear this critical voice saying ""This is stupid"" or ""You're just making excuses."" That resistance? That's actually your protective part trying to keep you safe. And instead of fighting it, we need to get curious about it.

Try this – next time you feel that resistance, take a moment to acknowledge it: ""Hey, I see you're trying to protect me here. Thank you for that. What are you afraid might happen if we let our guard down?"" This simple shift from judgment to curiosity can be absolutely transformative.

But here's where it gets really deep – and stick with me here because this is important: Your inner child isn't just some metaphorical concept. There's actually a part of your brain that still holds those early emotional memories and experiences. When we do inner child work, we're literally creating new neural pathways that can help regulate our nervous system.

I had this profound experience during my own healing journey where I realized that my inner critic – you know, that voice that's always telling you you're not good enough – was actually the internalized voice of my caregivers trying to keep me safe in the only way they knew how. Understanding this didn't immediately make the voice go away, but it changed my relationship with it completely.

Here's another mind-bender for you: Sometimes the resistance to self-compassion comes from a place of grief. Because when we start being kind to ourselves, we often begin to feel the full weight of how much kindness we didn't receive when we needed it most. And that shit hurts. Like, really hurts.

But – and this is crucial – feeling that grief is actually part of the healing process. It's like cleaning out an infected wound. Yeah, it's gonna sting like hell at first, but that's how we make room for the healing to happen.

I want you to know that if you're feeling overwhelmed right now, that's completely normal. This work is deep, and it's okay to take it slow. Remember, we're not trying to eliminate parts of ourselves – we're trying to integrate them. Every part of you, even the ones that feel broken or scared or angry, played a role in getting you this far.

Think of it like this: Your inner child isn't something you need to fix – they're someone you need to listen to and understand. They've been carrying some heavy stuff for a long time, and they're probably pretty tired. Our job isn't to make them disappear; it's to show them that it's safe to rest now.

And look, I know this might sound a bit woo-woo to some of you, and that's okay. I was skeptical as hell when I first started this work. But I've seen it transform lives – including my own – in ways that still amaze me. The key is to approach it with that compassionate curiosity we talked about, and to remember that healing isn't linear. Some days you'll feel like you're making huge progress, and others you'll feel like you're right back where you started. That's all part of the process.

Let's transition now into looking at some specific tools and practices that can help you put all of this into action...

You know what really brings this home? The stories I hear from our community. Like Sarah's email from last week - she wrote about how she'd always criticized herself for ""acting like a child"" when triggered. Man, that hit close to home. She described sitting in her car after a rough work meeting, literally hiding and feeling ashamed because she wanted to cry. But here's where it gets good - she remembered what we'd talked about regarding self-compassion and decided to try something different.

Instead of berating herself, she actually spoke to that hurting part of herself like she would to a scared kid. ""It's okay to feel overwhelmed,"" she told herself. ""This meeting brought up some old stuff, and that's perfectly normal."" Sarah said it felt weird at first, like she was playing pretend, but then something shifted. The tension in her chest started to ease up, and she could breathe again.

And then there's Marcus - holy shit, his story still gives me goosebumps. He wrote about growing up with a parent who used silence as punishment, sometimes going days without speaking to him. As an adult, he realized he was doing the same thing to himself - giving himself the silent treatment whenever he made a mistake. Through working with his inner child, he started leaving himself voice notes of encouragement. Can you believe he kept every single one? He plays them back when that old shame spiral starts kicking in.

Here's what gets me about these stories - they show how this isn't just some fluffy self-help concept. This is real healing happening in real time. Like Jen, who shared how she finally understood why she panicked every time she had to ask for help. Her inner child was still living in that space where asking for anything meant being told she was ""too needy"" or ""attention-seeking."" She started keeping a photo of herself at age six on her phone, and whenever she needs to reach out for support, she looks at that little girl and thinks, ""Would I tell her she's too needy?""

Let me share something that came in just yesterday - it's from Alex, who's been struggling with perfectionism that was literally paralyzing them in their creative work. They described sitting down to paint, something they used to love, and feeling absolutely frozen with fear of making mistakes. But then they tried something we discussed in a previous episode - they started painting with their non-dominant hand. Why? Because it made it impossible to be perfect. Their inner critic had to take a back seat, and suddenly, that young, creative part of them that just wanted to play with colors came alive again.

These stories remind me of something crucial - healing isn't about erasing our past or becoming some idealized version of ourselves. It's about creating space for all the parts of us to exist and be heard. Like Rachel, who realized her inner critic, as harsh as it was, had actually been trying to protect her all along. She wrote about having this breakthrough moment where she thanked that critical voice for trying to keep her safe, even though the methods were outdated and harmful.

And you know what? Sometimes the breakthroughs come in the smallest moments. Tom wrote about how he caught himself automatically apologizing for taking up space in a grocery store aisle. But instead of spiraling into shame about it, he paused and remembered his inner child work. He actually smiled and told himself, ""You have every right to be here, buddy."" Simple? Yeah. Profound? Absolutely.

I'm particularly moved by Maria's story because it shows how this work ripples out to affect our relationships. She described how understanding and nurturing her own inner child completely transformed how she parents her daughter. Instead of reacting with frustration to her daughter's big emotions, she recognized her own childhood pain being triggered. By soothing her inner child first, she could then be present for her daughter in a way she never experienced herself.

Listen, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Great for them, but my stuff is different."" I get it. I really do. But that's why I'm sharing these stories - because healing shows up differently for everyone. Like Pat, who wrote about how they couldn't relate to the idea of talking to their inner child at first. Instead, they found their way in through movement - literally dancing with their younger self. They described it as ""finally letting that kid who was always told to sit still and be quiet just fucking move.""

The thread that runs through all these stories is permission - permission to try something different, permission to feel awkward doing it, permission to fail and try again. Jamie wrote about spending three weeks just trying to figure out what their inner child needed, feeling frustrated that they couldn't get it ""right."" But that process itself was healing because they were finally giving themselves the time and attention they never got as a kid.

These stories matter because they show us what's possible. They remind us that we're not alone in this work, that others are stumbling and succeeding right alongside us. And most importantly, they show us that healing happens in real, messy, beautiful ways that don't always look like what we expect.

So as we move into talking about specific tools and techniques, I want you to keep these stories in mind. Remember that your journey doesn't have to look like anyone else's. Your healing path is as unique as your story, and that's exactly how it should be.

So let's dig into some practical tools you can start using today to connect with and heal your inner child. I want to share some approaches that have really worked for both my clients and myself - because let's be real, I'm on this journey right alongside you.

One of the most powerful tools I've found is what I call the ""Safe Space Dialogue."" Now, this might sound a bit woo-woo at first, but stick with me here. Find a quiet spot where you won't be interrupted - maybe your bedroom, a cozy corner, or even your car if that's where you feel most secure. Get comfortable, close your eyes, and imagine your younger self sitting across from you. What age are they? What are they wearing? Really let yourself see them.

Here's where it gets interesting - and sometimes a bit uncomfortable, I'm not gonna lie. Start talking to them, out loud if you can. Tell them what you wish someone had told you back then. ""You're safe now."" ""It wasn't your fault."" ""I see how hard you're trying."" Whatever feels Published and necessary. And then - this is crucial - let yourself feel whatever comes up. If you cry, that's okay. If you feel angry, that's okay too. All of your responses are valid here.

You know what's fascinating? Sometimes people tell me they feel silly doing this exercise, but then they experience this profound shift. One of my clients - let's call her Sarah - told me she felt ridiculous talking to an empty chair until suddenly she burst into tears because she could finally tell her eight-year-old self that she didn't deserve what happened. That's the kind of breakthrough we're looking for.

Another tool that's been absolutely game-changing is what I call ""Present-Moment Parenting."" When you're feeling triggered or overwhelmed, pause and ask yourself: ""What would little me need right now?"" Maybe it's comfort, maybe it's permission to rest, maybe it's someone to say ""hey, you don't have to be perfect."" Then - and this is the magical part - give that to yourself. Actually do it. If little you needs a hug, wrap your arms around yourself. If little you needs to hear it's okay to make mistakes, say it out loud.

Now, here's something that might surprise you - play is actually a powerful healing tool. Yeah, I'm serious! When was the last time you did something just for fun, with no productive purpose? Our inner children often got robbed of play time, either literally or because they had to grow up too fast. So try this: pick one activity that your younger self loved - maybe coloring, building with LEGOs, climbing trees - and give yourself permission to do it. No judgment, no productivity goals, just pure enjoyment.

Let me share a personal example. I kept a box of crayons hidden in my desk drawer for months before I actually let myself use them. I felt so much shame about wanting to color, like I was being childish or wasting time. But the first time I actually sat down and colored for thirty minutes, it was like this weight lifted off my shoulders. It wasn't about the coloring itself - it was about giving myself permission to just be, without having to achieve anything.

Another crucial tool is what I call ""Emotional Time Travel."" When you're feeling triggered, try to identify which age you're feeling. Are you responding as your adult self, or is this reaction coming from your twelve-year-old self? Once you identify the age, you can respond more appropriately. If it's your younger self feeling scared, you can use your adult presence to provide safety and reassurance.

Here's something really important though - and I cannot stress this enough - these tools aren't about fixing or changing your inner child. They're about building a relationship with that part of yourself. Just like you wouldn't expect a child to immediately trust a stranger, your inner child might need time to trust you. Be patient. Be consistent. Show up again and again.

One more tool before we wrap up this section - create a comfort box. Fill it with things that make your inner child feel safe and soothed. Maybe it's a soft blanket, a stuffed animal, favorite snacks, photos that make you smile, or a playlist of songs from when you were young. When you're having a rough day or feeling triggered, you've got this tangible source of comfort ready to go.

Remember, these tools aren't about doing everything perfectly. They're about creating a gentle, consistent practice of showing up for yourself. Start small. Maybe try one tool for just five minutes a day. Notice what resonates with you and what doesn't. There's no one-size-fits-all approach here - your healing journey is uniquely yours.

And hey, if you're feeling resistance to any of these tools, that's completely normal. Our inner critic can be pretty loud when we start this work. Just acknowledge the resistance with compassion and keep taking those small steps forward. Every time you show up for your inner child, you're rewiring those old patterns of abandonment and neglect, creating new pathways of self-trust and self-compassion.

You know, another really powerful tool I've found helpful - and I use this one a lot myself - is what I call the ""Time Travel Dialogue."" Here's how it works: When you're feeling triggered or caught in those old trauma responses, take a moment to actually visualize yourself at the age when that wound first happened. Maybe you're seeing yourself as that scared seven-year-old, or that lonely teenager. Then, from your adult self, have an actual conversation with that younger you.

What's fascinating about this practice is how it helps bridge that disconnect between our adult logical brain and our emotional child brain. Like, the other day, I was feeling that familiar overwhelm spiral starting - you know the one, where everything feels like too much? Instead of pushing through it like I used to, I paused and visualized little Greg, probably around age six, feeling totally overwhelmed by all the chaos at home. And fuck, it hit different, you know?

I could see how that little guy needed someone to just sit with him, to tell him it wasn't his job to fix everything, that he was allowed to just be a kid. And here's where it gets really interesting - when we do this kind of dialogue, we're actually rewiring those neural pathways. We're giving our inner child what they needed back then, but we're doing it now, in real-time.

Let me share another practical approach that's been a game-changer for many folks in our community. I call it the ""Safety Anchor"" technique. Think about it - when we're triggered, our nervous system is responding to danger that happened decades ago. So we need to actively remind our body that we're safe now. This might look like creating a physical space in your home that feels completely secure - maybe a cozy corner with soft blankets, favorite photos, or objects that ground you in the present.

The key here - and this is crucial - is to use this space before you're in full activation. It's like building muscle memory for safety. Spend time there when you're relatively calm, really letting your body absorb that feeling of security. Then when shit hits the fan, your nervous system already knows the way back to that regulated state.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Greg, this sounds great, but what about when we're at work or in public?"" That's where portable anchors come in. Maybe it's a smooth stone in your pocket that reminds you of your adult strength, or a specific playlist that helps you reconnect with your present-day self. One listener - let's call her Sarah - shared how she keeps a small photo of herself as a child in her wallet. When she feels those old shame spirals starting, she looks at that photo and reminds herself to be as kind to herself as she would be to that little girl.

Something else that's been incredibly powerful for many of us is what I call ""Permission Slips."" This isn't about asking anyone else for permission - it's about actively giving ourselves permission to feel, to need, to set boundaries. Write yourself actual permission slips: ""I give myself permission to rest when I'm tired,"" ""I give myself permission to say no,"" ""I give myself permission to take up space."" It might sound silly at first, but there's something really powerful about explicitly stating these permissions we never got as kids.

And let's talk about resistance for a minute, because it's going to show up - that's just part of the process. When you start doing this work, parts of you might freak the fuck out. That's normal. Those parts have been working overtime for years to keep you safe in the ways they knew how. So when resistance shows up, try thanking it. Seriously. ""Thank you for trying to protect me. I hear you, and I'm going to take care of us in a new way now.""

Remember, healing isn't linear. Some days you'll feel like you're crushing it, really showing up for your inner child, and other days you'll fall back into old patterns. That's not failure - that's being human. The goal isn't perfection; it's building a new relationship with yourself, one gentle moment at a time.

What matters most is consistency, not intensity. Small, daily acts of self-compassion add up to massive change over time. Maybe it's taking three deep breaths before responding to a trigger, or putting your hand on your heart when you're feeling scared. These might seem like tiny gestures, but they're actually profound acts of rewiring your relationship with yourself.

You know what really gets me excited? Seeing how all these pieces we've talked about today start fitting together like this beautiful puzzle. The inner child work, the self-compassion practices, those tiny moments of pause and presence - they're all part of this intricate dance of healing.

And here's what I want you to remember: this isn't about becoming some perfectly healed version of yourself. It's about creating a relationship with all your parts - even the messy ones, even the ones that feel broken or scared. Sometimes that means sitting with your four-year-old self who's throwing a tantrum. Other times it's about letting your teenage self know it's okay to feel angry as hell.

I get it - this work can feel overwhelming. There are days when I still struggle with my own inner critic, when self-compassion feels about as natural as tap-dancing in space. But that's exactly why we keep showing up, why we keep practicing these tools, why we keep coming back to this conversation.

Next week, we're diving into mindfulness and how it plays into our healing journey. But until then, remember: you're not alone in this. Your story matters. Your healing matters. And every small step you take toward treating yourself with kindness is a revolutionary act of healing.

Next episode will be Rewriting Your Story: Moving Past Trauma	NEEDS REVIEW			"Hey there, fellow travelers on this healing journey. I'm Gregory, and you're listening to ""CPTSD: Let's Make Sense of This Shit."" Today, we're diving deep into something that's been a game-changer in my own recovery, and I bet many of you have been curious about it too – mindfulness and its role in our everyday healing from Complex PTSD.

You know those moments when everything feels overwhelming, when your trauma responses are firing on all cylinders, and you just wish you had a pause button? Well, that's exactly what we're exploring today. But don't worry – this isn't going to be some woo-woo discussion about floating on clouds or achieving perfect inner peace. We're talking real, practical mindfulness that works in the messy reality of living with CPTSD.

Throughout this episode, we'll unpack how mindfulness can be your ally in those tough moments – whether you're dealing with emotional flashbacks at work, navigating challenging relationships, or just trying to get through your daily routine without being hijacked by your trauma responses. I'll share some stories from our community, including one that honestly changed how I view mindfulness myself.

We'll also look at what the research says about mindfulness and trauma healing, but I promise to break it down in a way that actually makes sense and feels relevant to our lives. You'll learn some practical techniques that don't require you to sit cross-legged for hours or become a meditation guru – because let's face it, who has time for that?

What I'm most excited about is showing you how to weave mindfulness into your existing routine in ways that feel natural and sustainable. We're talking small, doable steps that can make a real difference in how you experience and manage your CPTSD symptoms.

So grab your favorite comfort beverage, find a cozy spot, and let's explore how mindfulness can become part of your healing toolkit. And remember, wherever you are in your healing journey right now, that's exactly where you need to be.

You know what? Before we dive deeper into all of this, let's take a moment together. I know we've been covering some heavy stuff, and I can feel my own body getting a bit tense just talking about it. So let's do what I like to call a ""quick reset"" - nothing fancy, just checking in with ourselves.

Take a breath with me, wherever you are right now. Maybe you're driving (keep those eyes on the road!), doing dishes, or curled up on that comfy chair you love. Whatever you're doing, just notice how your body feels in this moment. No judgment, no trying to change anything - we're just gathering information.

Notice where you're carrying tension. For me, it's usually in my shoulders - they creep up toward my ears like they're trying to become earrings. Maybe for you it's your jaw, your belly, or that spot between your shoulder blades. Just notice it. And here's the thing - we're not trying to force relaxation. Sometimes just acknowledging where we're holding stuff is enough.

Take another breath with me. Let it be messy and imperfect - because honestly, when is healing ever Instagram-worthy? Feel your feet connecting with the floor, or if you're lying down, notice where your body meets the surface supporting you. That's gravity doing its thing, holding you right here, right now.

You might notice thoughts popping up - maybe about what we discussed earlier, or your to-do list, or wondering if you remembered to feed the cat. That's totally normal. Our minds are like enthusiastic puppies, always wanting to show us something new. Just gently bring your attention back to your body, back to your breath.

One more breath together. And as you breathe, remember that this moment - this exact moment - is your body's chance to reset. It's like hitting the pause button on your Netflix binge, except we're pausing the chaos in our nervous system.

Feel that? That slight shift? Maybe it's subtle, maybe it's dramatic, or maybe you're not feeling much of anything right now. All of those responses are perfectly okay. This is your journey, and your body knows exactly what it needs.

Now, keeping that awareness with you, let's move forward together. Because everything we're about to explore becomes so much more powerful when we're present in our bodies, even if that presence feels uncomfortable at first.

You know what fascinates me about mindfulness in CPTSD healing? It's like we're all carrying these invisible backpacks filled with past experiences, and mindfulness gives us this gentle way to peek inside without getting overwhelmed by everything we find in there.

Let me share something that happened to me last week. I was doing dishes – yeah, the most mundane thing ever – when I noticed this tight sensation in my shoulders. Now, pre-healing Gregory would have ignored it completely or gone into full panic mode about what it ""meant."" But instead, I just... noticed it. Stayed with it. And you know what? That simple act of acknowledging without judgment – that's mindfulness in action, folks.

Here's where it gets really interesting. When we're dealing with CPTSD, our minds often feel like they're running this exhausting marathon between past trauma and future anxiety. But mindfulness? It's like hitting the pause button on that marathon. It brings us back to this moment, right here, where we're actually safe. And I cannot stress enough how revolutionary that simple shift can be.

Think about it – when was the last time you really tasted your morning coffee? Or felt the texture of your steering wheel during your commute? These tiny moments of presence are actually little acts of rebellion against our trauma responses. They're saying, ""Hey, I deserve to be here, now, in this moment.""

I know what some of you are thinking – ""Greg, that sounds great and all, but my mind is like a squirrel on energy drinks."" Trust me, I get it. My first attempts at mindfulness looked more like mental gymnastics than peaceful awareness. But here's the thing that changed everything for me: mindfulness isn't about emptying your mind or achieving some zen-master state. It's about building a different relationship with our thoughts and sensations.

Sometimes that means simply noticing that you're breathing. Sometimes it means acknowledging, ""Wow, I'm really in my head right now,"" and that acknowledgment itself is mindfulness. It's like building a muscle – you don't start by lifting the heaviest weights in the gym, right?

What makes mindfulness particularly powerful for us CPTSD survivors is that it creates this tiny space between trigger and response. It's like having a pause button where there used to be just an automatic reaction. And in that pause, that microscopic moment of awareness, we get to choose. We get to respond instead of react.

The beauty of this approach is that it meets you exactly where you are. Having a terrible day where even breathing feels hard? That awareness is mindfulness. Feeling disconnected from your body? Noticing that disconnection is mindfulness. There's no failing at this – there's just noticing and beginning again, as many times as we need to.

And let me tell you something that took me years to learn: this practice of gentle awareness, of coming back to the present moment over and over, it's not just a coping tool – it's actually rewiring our trauma-affected nervous systems. Each time we choose to notice without judgment, we're laying down new neural pathways. We're literally rebuilding our relationship with ourselves, one mindful moment at a time.

So maybe today, just for a moment, notice where you are right now. Feel the weight of your body wherever you're sitting or standing. Take in the sounds around you. This is mindfulness in action – simple, accessible, and profound in its ability to bring us home to ourselves.

So now that we've laid that groundwork, let's try something together. I promise this won't be one of those awkward meditation moments where I tell you to imagine yourself as a floating cloud or whatever. This is real, practical stuff that you can use anywhere, anytime.

I want you to stay right where you are – no need to get into some pretzel-like position or light incense. Just notice your breath for a moment. Not changing it, not trying to make it deeper or slower. Just noticing. Yeah, it might feel a little weird at first. That's totally normal. Hell, I still sometimes feel like I'm doing it wrong, and I've been at this for years.

Here's what we're going to do for the next few minutes. Every time you notice a thought – and trust me, they'll come barging in like uninvited relatives at Thanksgiving – just label it. Not judging it, just noting: ""Oh, that's thinking."" Could be planning, worrying, remembering, whatever. Just ""thinking.""

If you notice physical sensations – maybe your leg is falling asleep, or you're aware of tension somewhere – label that as ""feeling."" Sounds around you? ""Hearing."" Simple as that. Three labels: thinking, feeling, hearing. No need to get fancy with it.

You might notice your mind wandering off to that awkward thing you said three years ago, or your growing to-do list, or wondering if you remembered to lock the door. That's perfectly fine. Each time you catch yourself wandering, just gently come back to labeling. Think of it like training a puppy – you wouldn't yell at a puppy for getting distracted, right? Same gentle approach here.

Let's do this for about three minutes. I'll be quiet, but I'm right here with you. And if you're driving or doing something that needs your attention, just bookmark this for later.

How was that? If you found your mind ping-ponging all over the place, congratulations – you're human! That's exactly what minds do. The magic isn't in having an empty mind; it's in noticing when we've wandered off and coming back, over and over again.

This simple practice is like building a muscle. Each time you notice you've drifted and come back to labeling, that's one rep. You're strengthening your ability to be present, to step back from the chaos of trauma responses, even if just for a moment.

And here's the beautiful thing – you can do this anywhere. Waiting in line at the grocery store, stuck in traffic, lying awake at 3 AM. No special equipment needed, no subscription required. Just you, noticing what's happening right now, one label at a time.

Remember, this isn't about getting rid of thoughts or feelings. It's about creating a little bit of space around them, so they don't completely hijack our nervous system. And sometimes, that little bit of space is all we need to respond rather than react.

You know what else I've found really powerful? The ""Then and Now"" practice. I stumbled onto this one during a particularly rough patch when my own trauma responses were going haywire, and it's become one of my go-to tools for getting grounded.

Here's how it works – and I want you to try this with me if you're in a safe space right now. Think about something that regularly triggers your trauma response. Maybe it's a certain tone of voice, or being in a crowded space, or even something as simple as getting an unexpected text message. Got it? Okay, now here's where it gets interesting.

Take a moment to notice where you are right now. I mean really notice – the temperature of the air on your skin, the surface you're sitting or standing on, any sounds around you. This is your ""now."" Then, gently acknowledge that part of you that's carrying that old fear, that old pain. That's your ""then.""

The magic happens when we can hold both of these truths at once: ""Back then, I wasn't safe, AND right now, in this moment, I am."" It's like having one foot in each world, but consciously choosing which one gets more of our attention.

I remember working with this practice when I was dealing with my own fear of confrontation. My body would go into full panic mode anytime someone raised their voice, even slightly. Through this practice, I learned to say to myself, ""Yes, raised voices meant danger then. AND right now, I'm an adult in my own space, capable of setting boundaries.""

The 'AND' is crucial here – we're not dismissing or minimizing what happened. We're simply creating a bridge between our past experiences and our present reality. It's like updating our internal GPS, showing us where we actually are rather than where we used to be.

What I love about this practice is how it helps us develop what I call ""emotional bifocals"" – the ability to see both our past and present clearly, without one completely overshadowing the other. It's not about forcing yourself to ""get over it"" or ""move on."" It's about gently expanding your perspective to include your current resources and safety.

Try practicing this a few times a day, especially when you notice those old patterns kicking in. Remember, you're not trying to erase the past – you're simply reminding your nervous system that you're here, now, with more options and resources than you had before.

You know what I love about this mindfulness work? It's not about becoming some enlightened guru floating above all your problems. It's about getting real with yourself, right here in the messy middle of life. And sometimes that means acknowledging that this shit is hard, and that's okay.

I remember when I first started practicing mindfulness, I kept waiting for this magical moment when everything would click into place. Spoiler alert: that's not how it works. Instead, what I found – and what I see in my clients – is that healing happens in these tiny moments of awareness. It's in catching yourself before you spiral into that familiar anxiety loop. It's in noticing when you're holding your breath and consciously choosing to take that deep exhale.

Here's what I want you to take away from our conversation today: You don't have to do this perfectly. You don't even have to do it well. You just have to show up and be willing to notice what's happening in your body and mind with a little more curiosity and a little less judgment.

Start small. Maybe it's just taking three mindful breaths when you wake up. Maybe it's feeling your feet on the floor while you're washing dishes. Whatever it is, make it yours. Make it real. Make it something that actually fits into your life.

Remember, you're not broken, and you don't need fixing. You're a human being who's survived some really tough shit, and now you're learning new ways to be present with yourself. That's pretty fucking brave if you ask me.
