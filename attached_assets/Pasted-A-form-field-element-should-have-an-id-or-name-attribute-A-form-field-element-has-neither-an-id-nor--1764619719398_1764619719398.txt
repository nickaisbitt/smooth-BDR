A form field element should have an id or name attribute
A form field element has neither an id nor a name attribute. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.

To fix this issue, add a unique id or name attribute to a form field. This is not strictly needed, but still recommended even if you have an autocomplete attribute on the same element.

Content Security Policy blocks inline execution of scripts and stylesheets
The Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents cross-site scripting attacks by blocking inline execution of scripts and style sheets.

To solve this, move all inline scripts (e.g. onclick=[JS code]) and styles into external files.

⚠️ Allowing inline execution comes at the risk of script injection via injection of HTML script elements. If you absolutely must, you can allow inline script and styles by:

adding unsafe-inline as a source to the CSP header
adding the hash or nonce of the inline script to your CSP header.

Content Security Policy of your site blocks some resources
Some resources are blocked because their origin is not listed in your site's Content Security Policy (CSP). Your site's CSP is allowlist-based, so resources must be listed in the allowlist in order to be accessed.

A site's Content Security Policy is set either via an HTTP header (recommended), or via a meta HTML tag.

To fix this issue do one of the following:

(Recommended) If you're using an allowlist for 'script-src', consider switching from an allowlist CSP to a strict CSP, because strict CSPs are more robust against XSS. See how to set a strict CSP.
Or carefully check that all of the blocked resources are trustworthy; if they are, include their sources in the CSP of your site. ⚠️Never add a source you don't trust to your site's CSP. If you don't trust the source, consider hosting resources on your own site instead.
